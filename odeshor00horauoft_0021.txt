of the verse, and is marked off below by a dotted line ( ξ ).
This syllable may be long or short.

In many verses the last foot is incomplete, a pause
compensating for the missing syllable ε sueh verses are
termed ‘⁶ oataleetio ’' (i.e. “ stopping short '’). Verses in
which the last foot is complete are called “ aeataleetie.''

The last syllable of a verse is in practice either long or
short without regard to its theoretica] length3 only the
latter is given in the schemes below.

(laesura (“ cutting '') is a break at a fixed place in the
verse, and must coineide with the end of a word; it is
indicated by the sign Η. ansura occurs once in most kinds
of verse, and twice in some 3 it may come in the middle or
at the ond of a foot.

The Odes of Horace are, with but few exceptions, written
in (a) the Aleaic stanza, (b) the Sapphjo stanza, or (ο) one
of the five Aselepiad systemS. All these measures are
troehaic.

(α) The following is the scheme of the Alcaic stanza :—

Ci-ul->lfl-uul—ul—
Qi-ul—>ll—uul-ul—
ῧΞ-υΙ») '‘ul—v
*’del-vkdi—Ui—kl

This is the metre of 37 Odes; the first of them (Ι. 9)
begins thus :—
Vi*- ξ des ἷιῒ, ι alta Η εῖθῢ nive 1 οᾷῃάἶ- Ι dum
δῖ)- 3 racte, Ι nee iarn ll 3υέῢῖηέ- lant ’6-1 nus

Flumina l constite- l rint Ξ,- i outo.
(b) In the Sapphio stanza (sometimes called “ F irst
Sapphie '') the first three lines are alike :—

-υ Ι -> Ι -vu 1 -υ ι -υ(νεὲ]τ5ε·,31.3).
-υ υ Ι - υ(νει·εε 4).

Caesura occurs in each of the first three verses of the

fi'ffiie line is catalecti03 the pause compensates for the missing
sy a e.
