220 HoRACE, oDEs 111., 23.

5. sentiet: this stands as predicate to vitis and seqes, and
(changed into the plural) to alumni. Africum: the south-west
wind, so called as blowing towards Italy from the direction of
Africa. It is a hot and parching wind, which blights the green crOPS.

7. aut: distinguishing what follows (diseases of the flock) from
what precedes (diseases of the crops); whereas ‘nec . . . nec distin-
guish only between two cases of the latter, the vines and the corn.
alumni : cp. xviii. 4, n.

8. pomifero anno: “ when the year is bearing fruit,” i.e. in the
autumn, which is unhealthy (qrave) in the greater part of Italy.
Pomum means any fruit.

10. devota: “ doomed ’' to be sacrificed. quercus: the preposi-
tion follows its case, as in iu'.11. Victima (v. 12) is the antecedent
of quae (v. 9) and subject of linquet (v. 13).

12. pontificum t (from pons, a bridge or road,-{— facere) the highest
religious officers in Rome, the Pontiffs. They had the superinten-
dence of the worship of all the gods, and of all public sacrifices. The
victims which they used were naturally the best which could be got.
The original number of the Pontifices was five. This was increased
(by the Lea: Oyulnia, 300 13.c.) to nine, and subsequently to sixteen,
which was the number in Horace's time. secures ε here the poll-axe
used for slaughtering a large victim such as an ox.

13. te : in prose attinet usually takes the accusative with ad.
Nihil is accusative of extent, “ to no degree‚’' ‘⁶ in no wise.”

15. coronantem: agreeing with te (v. 13) and equivalent to a
conditional clause, ‘⁶ if thou wreathe them.'’

17. inmunis: “bringing no gift ”; from in -ξ- munus. The
meaning “ stainless,'’ which some authorities give to the word here,
is unparalleled and impossible; whereas Horace in two other
passages (Odes IV. xii. 23; Ep. Ι. xiv. 33) uses it in the sense of
“with empty hand‚” “ without a gift.‘’

18. sumptuosa hostia : (1) if these words are, as the metre seems
to show, in the ablative, the line is parenthetical, blandior referring
to manus in v. 17 ; “ (thy hand) no more persuasive with (ablative
of instrument) a costly sacrifice,” i.e. ‘⁶ that would not be more
persuasive were it to offer a costly sacrifice.’‘ (2) But some scholars,
disliking the harsh parenthesis, hold that sumptuosa hostia may be
nominative, the short a at the end of sumptuosa forming a long
syllable with the following bl. If this is so, the comma after hostia
must be removed, and hostia becomes the subject of mollivit : ‘⁶ a
costly sacrifice has not more persuasively appeased the estranged
household gods than holy meal,’' etc„ farre being ablative of the
standard of comparison. Against this rendering there is not only
the metrical difficulty, but also the awkwardness of the two adjectives
sumptuosa and blandior applied to one substantive.

20. saliente mica: “craekling grain (of salt).'' Mica properly
