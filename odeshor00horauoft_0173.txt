Norus. 165

5. Aiacem: called ‘⁴ the son of Telamon '³ to distinguish him from
Ajax the Less, son of Oueus. He married Tecmessa, daughter of
Teleutas, king of Phrygia, a captive slave.

7. Atrides : Agamemnon fell in love with Cassandra, daughter of
Priam‚ and took her home to Argos, where both were murdered by
his queen Clytaemnestra.

9. cecidere . . . tradidit: English requires the past-perfect, “had
fallen . . . had handed over.’'

10. Thessalo victore : not an ablative of the agent (which would
require the preposition a, ab), but an ablative absolute. Thessalus
is Achilles, who came from Phthia in Thessaly. ademptus Hector τ
lit. “ Hector removed,'' i.e¹ “ the removal of Hector.’' The Roman
preference for concrete to abstract phraseology often causes a (con-
crete) noun and participle to be used to express the action itself.

11. tolli: with leviora. Such a use of the infinitive dependent
upon an adjective is not allowable in prose, but forms a special
feature in the Latin of Horace. Cp. indoctus ferre, vi. 2 ; and com-
pare Book I.‚ iii. 25, vi. 6, x. 7 xii. 10, xviii. 18, xxxv. 2, 28.

12. Pergama: Perqama, -orum or Perqamum, -i—the citadel of
Troy, and so used for the city itself.

13. nescias an : when an introduces an apparently single question,
the implication is that the alternative mentioned is the right one.
Here nescias is potential: “you would not know, if asked,” and
may be rendered “ for all you know.” But Horace does not mean
this stanza, or indeed anything in the Ode, to be taken too seriously.

15. genus : this may be taken either as nominative, the subject
of est (understood) ; or as accusative, the object of [Phyllis] maeret.

16. iniquos ε aequus signifies (1) level ; (2) just, considerate ;
(3) kind. Iniquus signifies the opposite in all three senses, the last
being that which is here conveyed.

17. tibi ε dative of the agent. De scelesta plebe is predicative.

19. potuisse nasci z possum, debeo, ete„ are in this sense con-
structed with a present infinitive, and themselves take whatever
tense-sign the English transfers to the dependent infinitive‚ ey.
debui facere, “ I ought to have done.'’

20. matre : ablative of origin.

22. integer: from in (= not) and tay (root of tanyo, to touch),
“ intact,'⁷ i.e. “ beart-whole.’'

24. claudere: see on iii. 12. lustrum: properly the sacrifice of
purification performed by the Censors at the close of their census in
every fifth year. Hence it comes to mean “ a term of five years.”
As Horace was born in 65 B.c., the date of this ode must be 25 B.c.
