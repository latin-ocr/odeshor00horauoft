l. recinentis : the prefix implies that the note was repeated many
times. The “omen of the owl ’² is the sign of bad luck, which its
note was supposed to give. The birds used in augury (see note on
iii. 61) were divided into (a) oscines aves, which gave omens by their
note (os-cen, from os and εᾶηο); and (b) praepetes aves, which gave
them by their flight (praepes, -e'tis, from prae and peto). The various
animals mentioned below are all ill-omened, except the raven (corvus)
in v. ll.

5. †rumpat: jussive subjunctive, expressing a wish. There is a
variant reading rumpit, which makes the whole passage a statement
as to what occurrences may be looked upon as bad omens.

6. per obliquum: “ across their path ” (lit. ‘⁴ sideways ”). The
neuter adjective is used as a substantive, as in ex occulto (⁴⁴ scoretly ”),
per tacitum (“ quietly ”),

7. cui timebo : the order is eqo prece suscitabo (ei) cui timebo
oscinem corvum, and both datives are of advantage. The tense of
timebo is due to the future tense of the main verb suscitabo.

8. auspex: here equivalent to auqur, but generally used in the
derived sense of “ director,” “leader,'’ as augurs were consulted
before any transaction of importance.

9. repetat ι the subjunctive is one of purpose, the purpose being
the prevention of the occurrence of the action expressed by the
subjunctive before that of the main clause (suscitabo) is accomplished.

lO. divina : “ divinely inspired‚’' “ prophetie '’; hence the objec-
tive genitive imbrium. The bird is apparently the crow (cornix),
which is called aquae auqur, xvii. 12; perhaps the heron. Notice
the unusual form of the genitive, inminentum; cp. clientum, Ode v.
53, n.

11. oscinem : see v. l, n.

13. sis licet : sis is jussive (cp. rumpat, v. 5) 3 licet is parenthetica„
and equivalent to per me licet—‘⁴ be happy, (as far as I am concerned)
you may.''

14. nostri : cp. xi. 51, n.

15. laevus: “appearing on the left hand'’ (sinistra), and so
‘⁴ unlucky‚’' whence our word “ sinisterss’ The bird “ forbids,” as
being itself the forbidding sign. †vetat : there is a variant reading
vetet, jussive subjunctive.

17. trepidet: dependent question. So sit and peccet. The verb
belongs closely to pronus—‘⁴ hurries to its setting.” Orion sets
about the beginning of November.
