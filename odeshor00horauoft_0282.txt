274 HonAcn : omis.

Paeligni, orum. m. (hence adj. Paelignus, -a, -um) : inhabitants
of a cold and mountainous district farther east from Rome than the
country of the Marsi (III. xix. 8).

Palinurus, i, m. : capo di Palinuro. See ΙΙΙ. iv. 28, η.

Pallas, -adis, f. : av. Mmmwn.

Paphos, -i, m. : av. CYPRUS.

Paris, -idia m. ε (also called Alexander) one of the sons of
Priamus, king of Troy. WVhen the goddesses Hera (Juno), Athem}
(Minerva), and Aphrodite (Venus), disputed as to which was the
fairest, they appealed to Paris to decide. (Paris is hence called
iudex in III. iii. 19). He was induced by Aphrodite's promise of
the fairest woman on earth for his wife to decide in her favour, and
thereby made Hera and Athfina bitter enemies of Troy. Guided by
Aphrodite he sailed to Greece and carried off HELENA (q.v.). He
slew Achilles, and soon after died by an arrow-wound inflicted by
Philoctetes.

Parrhasius, -ἱ, m.: see IV. viii. 6, n.

Parthus, -i, m. : a Parthian, a native of Parthia, the country to the
S. E. of the Caspian. South and west of them were the MfflssMedz'ans),
and further south still the Persae (Persium) ; but the name Parthus
is used vaguely by Horace for all three peoples (Ι. iii. 51 ; ΙΙ. i. 31 ;
111. ii. 3). They provoked a war with Rome in 52 B.c.‚ when they
annihilated an army, and killed its commender, the famous Crassus,
at CARRHAE. They were compelled to make peace again by Ven-
tidius, who twice defeated them nc. 39-38. Augustus intended
to chastise them3 but civil war in Parthia between two claimants
to the throne, PRAnfi'rns IV. (or Phraates; ΙΙ. ii. 17) and
Tnunims (Ι. xxvi. 5), ended in an appeal to his arbitration. He
supported the claim of Prahates, and obtained the restoration of the
standards taken from Crassus. This appeal for arbitration is con-
struezl by Horace and other writers as equivalent to doing homage
to Augustus. The Parthians had a peculiar style of fighting, never
coming to close qnarters, but discharging their arrows baokxvards
as they rode (Ι. xix. 12). Augustus never triumphed over them
(Ι. xii. 53).

Patara, -ae, f. (hence adj. Patareus, -a, -um): a coast town of
Lycia, at the extreme S.W. of Asia Minor. It was famous for its
worship of Apollo, who had an oracle there, and is hence called
Patareus (111. iv. 64).

Paullus, -i‚ m. : Paullus Maximus, an unknown person spoken of
highly in Ode i. He was a skilful pleader (IV. i. 14, η.), and bada
villa probably near the Alban Lake.

Pegasus, -i‚ m. ε the winged horse which sprang from the blood
of the Gorgon. See av. Bannmopnbx. Pegasus flew to heaven
after its rider's death, and was placed amongst the stars (IV. xi. 27).

Peleus, -ei, m. : king of the Myrmidones of Phthia in Thessaly,
and father of Achilles. He was falsely accused by Hippolyte. wife
of Acastus king of Iolcus, in whose palace he was residing (III vii.
17). The story is much the same as that of Bellerophontes (q.v.).
