impression oi too much seriousness, and relieves a serious
poem by placing it in the company of lighter oneS. And
again, the first nine poems of Book I. are all different in
metre. Book ΙΙΙ., more serious than Books I. and IL, has
a moral and political purpose more definitely stamped by
the six opening Odes, all part of one general plan and in
the same metre ; but, by way of compensation, fancy has
a freer hand in the rest of the Book, Book IV., in respect
of plan as in other respects, stands by itsels, being a model
of artistic arrangement : it contains four chief poems (Odes
4, 5, 14, 15), two sets of two, in each set an Ode in praise
of Augustus’ step-sons preceding one in honour of Augustus
himself. The other poems are employed to set them in

specially imitates are Alcaeus, Alcman‚' Archilochus,
Asclepiades, Hipponax, Pindar, and Sappho. The metres
in which he has written are named after several of these.

Alcaeus was a native of Mytilene in Lesbos, born about
650 Β.ο. He belonged to the aristocratic party, and fought
under Pittacus against the despots Melanchrus and Myrsilus;
by the latter he was banished, and travelled to Egypt. On
his return he opposed Pittacus, who was now despot, and
was taken prisoner, but pardoned. On one occasion, in a
battle against the Athenians at Sigeum, he threw away his
shield, as did Horace six centuries later at Philippi, and
