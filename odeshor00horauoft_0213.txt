No'rEs. 205

these are here meant, or simply the trees of some neighbouring
public garden like our “ squa1·es.''

7. ut ε as in vii. 13. The question depends upon audis, but as one
cannot hear it freeze, audis is here used for seniis, “ perceive.” See
the note on refer, vi. 6. Posilas is ‘⁴ fallen.” In the next line

· Jupiter’s “ unclouded godhead ⁷³ is the clear sky of frosty weather.

10. rota τ the speaker compares himself to a rope which is strained
by a windlass. As the wheel goes on, the rope may break under the
strain, and the loosened end will fly backwards. If Lyce wears out
his patience, it will break, and he will leave her.

14. viola: there was a yellow variety of violet, so that the
line may refer to wan cheeks. Possibly it alludes to the dark
purplish rings which form under the eyes in ill-health.

15. vir : ‘⁴ husband,” as in v. 2. saucius : as we say “ smitten ”
with love. We should expect a paelice, as a person is meant; but
the idea of person sinks into that of instrument (ablative without
preposition), as in Illarte populata, Ode v. 24.

16. curvat : see the note on conspicitur, vii. 26.
17. parcas ε jussive subjunctive.

18. animum t “ in heart‚” accusative of the part concerned (also
called accusative of respect), usually of parts of the body, and found
in poetry with adjectives and verbs. In prose the ablative is used,

19. hoc: equivalent to meum, “this of mine.” liminis: he has
been lying upon her doorstep. Present participles used as adjec-
tives require an objective genitive. Thus patiens laboris = “ one
who can endure toil ’'; but patiens laborem = ‘⁴ a (particular) man
who is enduring tofl.” Aquae is “ rain,'' as in i. 30.

ODE XI.
OF 'mn Powm OF Musm, AND THE STORY or THE DANAIDS.

ARGUMENT.—O M ercury ,Ι and Ο lyre once mute, now tuneful .·
help me ιο prevail over Dyde's obstinacy: for she shuns me like an
unbrolcen filly. The lyre can charm savaye beasts, yea, Cerberus
himself, and the qhosts of the tormenled dead. Even Danaus’ dauqhters
§topped to hearlcen ,Ι

Let Lyde learn, srom the fate of those brides who slew their husbands‚
how stern is the punishment of cruelty. Only one was merciful .· she
saved her husband at the peril of her life, and only ashed that he would
remember her when she was no more.

[See Index for Danaus, Ixion, Numidae, Tityos]

1. Mercuri: this is the regular form of the vocative of proper
names in -ius (second declension). docilis : to be taken closely with the

ablatives te maqistro (ablative absolute)—“ quick to learn with thee
for his teacher.’'
