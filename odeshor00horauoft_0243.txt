NOTES. 235

2. ope Daedalea ε the words may go with ‘nititur ; but it is more
natural to take them with ceratis—“ relies on wings wax-bound by
the device of Daedalus.” Daedalus (Daedalsas is an adjective)
made for himself, and for his son Icarus, wings which were
fastened with wax. The two attempted to fly across the sea, but
Icarus was drowned in the attempt, and “ gave his name '² to the
Mare Icarium, north of Crete. The cause of Icarus’ mishap was
that he soared too high and the wax was melted by the sun ε hence
his fate is a warning to the too ambitious poet.

4. nomina: a poetical use of the plural for singular.

7. inmensus ruit: “pours unfathomable.'' The adjective is a
secondary predicate, and the expression is imitated from the regular
Greek idiom, πολὺς ῥεῖ-“ flows with a mighty stream.”

9. laurea ε the bay-tree was sacred to Apollo, and so to poets, of

whom he was the patron-deity. This and the three following
stanzas give four several styles of poetry in which Pindar carried
away the palm ε (1) Sacred Hymns (dithyrmnbi), vv. 10-12 ;
(2) Paeans (paee-mes), vv. 13-16, celebrating the great deeds of demi-
gods and heroes; (3) Songs of Victory (epinicia), vv. 17-20, in
honour of prize-winners at the Grecian games; (4) Dirges (threni)
and Panegyrics (encomia), vv. 21-24, lamenting the dead and
extolling their merits. Each of these classes is introduced by
seu or sive, excepting the fourth, which is connected by simple -ve
v. 21 .
( 10. )dithyrambos: a Greek word signifying sacred hymns sung
about the altar of Dionysus (Bacchus). The passionate character of
his worship was reflected in the hymns, which were full of
“ strange‚'' “unusual '³ (nova) expressions. How far Pindar’s
dithyrambs were irregular (Zeye solutis) in metre we cannot say,
as all are lost.

ll. numeris: musical “ measures,'' for which the common word
is menius.

14. sanguinem ε “children,’' in apposition to 'reyes ; the ancient
Greek kings claimed divine descent. per quos z i.e. Theseus (Index,
av. CENTAURI) and Bellerophon (Index, av. CHIMAERA).

18. palma: the victors in the Greek games carried a branch of
palm as the badge of their success 3 whence palma comes to mean
“victory.’' At the Olympio games the victor also wore a wreath
of wild olive. See IndeX‚ av. Ems. caelestes ι predicative—“lifted
up to heaven '' with pride and glory‚ “ godlike.''

20. munere : the Song of Victory, which contributes far more to
his fame than do statues (Siyna).

23. aureos: “noble ”3 the epithet belongs to all three nouus
preceding. educit in astra : i.e. “makes immortal.'⁷

25. multa: “ strong,'' “ greatst’ cycnum: poets are often called
swans, apparently on account of the legend that the swan sings
sweetly just before its death ; cp. Tennyson’s Dying] Swan.

26. tendit ε tendo is equally common as a transitive or intransitive
verb : ‘⁶ he goes '' is either tendit iter (carmem, etc.), or tendit. The
