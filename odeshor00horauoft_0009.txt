ξ 1. Life of Horace—QUINTUS HORATIUS FLACCUS, born
December 8th, 65 Β.ο., was the son of a freedman, a coactor,
or collector of moneys, occupying a small farm at Venusia
in Apulia. The birth of Horace occurred after the en-
franchisement of his father, so that he was iwanum, i.e.
the son of free parents ; but nevertheless he incurred some
cavil on the score of his parentage. At the age 01 twelve
or thereabouts he was brought to Rome to receive the best
education the city could give, and thus instead of attending
the country school whither many of his superiors in station
went, he became a pupil of some of the leading teachers
01 the senatorial and equestrian youth. In particular he
records his school days with one Orbilius, whose cane was
always in his hand. He went to Athens at the age of
eighteen, that being to Rome what the English Universities
are to us 3 and there he studied the Epicurean philosophy.

After the assassination of Caesar (44 B.c.) and the flight
of the murderers, one 01 them, Brutus, met Horace at
Athens, and appointed him to a command in the army
of the republican party. That army was routed at Philippi
in 42, and amongst the rest Horace left his shield behind
him and fled for his life. When the victorious party 01
Octavianus (Augustus) shortly afterwards issued free pardon
to the mass 01 the republicans, Horace immediately returned
to Italy. He found himself ruined—his father dead, his
farm confiscated, and himself without influence or property.
He took the post 01 6 clerk to the Quaestors, and turned to
composing Satires, the only field of literature not already
occupied by some contemporary writer. His verses caught
