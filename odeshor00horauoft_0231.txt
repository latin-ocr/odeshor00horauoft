quatenus ε “ inasmuch as,'' “ since.’' Heu nefas! is an exclamation
and syntactically forms no part of the sentence.

31. incolumem : “ while it is safe‚'' ale. ‘⁴ alive.'‘ So sublatam is
equivalent to “ when dead.'’ I nvidi belongs to both clauses¹

{atquidz supply proficiunt from v. 36; quid is accusative of
ex en -.

36. si : all from here to the end of v. 44 is a protasis dependent
on quid proficiunt? Si must therefore be understood before the
clauses beginning with horrida (v. 40) and maynum (v. 42).

I t37. ᾔτει i.e. the tropica-l regions. Join mundi with pars and
ausa e.

39. solo : “ on the ground‚” ablative of place without preposition
or epithet. Cp. i. 10, n.

42. opprobrium: appositive to pazzperies—“ (acoounted) a deep
disgrace.'’

45. vel nos : the verb is mittamus (v. 50); the objects are given
in v. 48. The treasures are to be dedicated to the gods in the
Capitoline temple.

46. clamor et turba: i.e. “the shouting mob.'’ This figure of
speech, in which two substantives stand for a substantive and adjec—
tive, is called hendiadys (from the Greek ἓν διὰ δυοῖν, “ one thing
through two ”).

50. mittamus: jussive subjunctive. scelerum: poenitet, piqet,
pudet, and taedet require a genitive of that which excites the feeling.
With poenitet here understand nos.

51. eradenda : the gerundive is here used as an adjective implying
necessity ; so, too, formandae, v. 54. For the gender of cupidinis,
see on xvi. 39, n.

54. equo ε either dative of indirect object with haerere, or ablative
of place.

55. haerere: cp. flectere sciens vii. 25, n. So ludere doctior,
v. 56. Inqenuus means born of free parents, especially of noble
parents3 what we usually mean by “a gentleman born.”

57. iubeas: supply eum ludere ; so too in v. 58 with malis (note
the quantity, — —). The subjunctives iubeas and malis are those of
conditional clauses relating to the future3 the epithet doctior forms
the apodosis, instead of a statement of that epithet’s being applicable.
Leqibus is instrumental, depending on vetita. Gambling was pro-
hibited, but special laws de alea are unknown.

59. cum : ‘⁴ because,” ‘⁶ since ’⁹ 3 as is shown by the mood offallat
and properet (subjunctive in causal clauses). The idea is ‘⁴ What
else can you expect from the son of such a father? '’

62. heredi : dative of advantage. He hastens to get a fortune to
leave to an heir who does not deserve it.

64. rei: “ fortune‚’' as in xvi. 25. It is dative in case. To the
