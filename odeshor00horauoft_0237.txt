ΙΛ[1;8ε’θ {ndex for Caecubum, Cnidos, Cyclades, Cynthus, Cyprus,
a ona.

l. festo die ε ablative of point of time. The feast of Neptune was
kept on July 23rd. Potius is an adjective (see ix. 2, n.)‚ predicative
ῐοὲῗηΐξοοίαῐη : potential subjunctive—“ could I do (if I were to try)?”
reconditum: the prefix (re— = “back ’') implies that the jar is at
thetgiagk of the apotheca (viii. 10, n.), and therefore one of an old
νυξὶ. {tett ε subjunctive, because the standing still is not represented
as a ac .

7. deripere ε for the infinit-ive with parco, cp. viii. 26, n. horreo :
properly a ‘⁶ granary ’' (cp. hordeum, “ barley '')‚ ‘⁶ a store-room.'‘

8. Bibuli: there was a Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus consul in 59
13.c., but the name is chosen here for the sake of a pun.

9. nos: this may here be equivalent to eyo; if it is not, the
sentence will be less symmetriam, but the meaning will still be
that Horace will sing of Neptune, Lyde of Diana, and both of Venus,

11. recines : “ sing in ans-wer (re-).’' Contrast recinentis, xxvii.
l, n.

13. summo carmine : “ at the end of our song.” This meaning of
summus is classical, but somewhat rare. The ablative is temporal.

14. fulgentes : in allusion to their marble eliffs and quarries.

15. iunctis : Venus was represented as riding in a ehariot drawn
by doves or swans.

16. dicetur: according to the punctuation in the text, this verb
must be understood with Nox. Others put the stop after oloribus,
instead of after dicetur, and understand cantabimus with summo
carmine. In either case nenia is instrumental ablative. nenia:
generally ‘⁵ a dirge‚’' but sometimes, as here, any trifling ditty. The
participle of the deponent mereor is often passive in sense, as here.

antidote for care. Resides, ’tis the deq-days, and worlc is impossible,
yet you still worry about politics. Believe me, the future is wisely hidden
