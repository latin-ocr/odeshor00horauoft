28. Palinurus : Cape di Palinuro, a small promontory in northern
Lucania, south of the Gulf of Paestum, said to take its name from
Palinurus, the pilot of Aeneas, who fell overboard and was there
washed ashore. Apparently Horace had once escaped shipwreek
here. Sicula unda is best taken as an ablative of instrument with
exstinxit. It is called ‘⁴ Sicilian ” because the point faces towards
Sicily.

29. utcumque : ‘⁴ whenever.” The more usual sense is “ however‚”
“in whatever way.’' eritis: English idiom requires the present
tense in place of the Latin future or future-perfect in relative and
conditional clauses. libens : Latin frequently uses an adjective

men. Here it stands generally for ‘⁶ armies.'’

41. consilium ε the last syllable disappears in scansion by elision of
-um before et, and the rest of the word counts as two long syllables,
the second i being treated as consonantal. dato ι sc. consilio leni.
The ease is the usual causal ablative with yaadeo, laetor, doleo, ete.

43. Titanas : note the quantity of the final syllable (-ἄ.ς) ; it is a
Greek accusative plural of the third deelension.
as ᾗ. νευῗὲιῌεῑίῡε subjunctive of dependent question (πίε “how‚”
