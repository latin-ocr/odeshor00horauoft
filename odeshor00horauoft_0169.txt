Addressed to Gaius Asinius Pollio, a supporter of Julius Caesar,
who triumphed 39 Rc. over the Parthini, an Illyrian tribe in arms
on behalf of Brutus and Cassius. He was a patron of literature,
and a friend of Horace and Vergil. The “History of the Civil lVars''
to which Horace here refers comprised the years 60-30 B.c. Pollio
was a successful tragic poet as well as an historian, but all his

writings have been lost.

1. motum z a noun, not the participle of moveo. Metello : Quintus
Caecilius Metellus was consul in the year of the First Triumvirate‚
60 B.c., and led the senatorian party against the league of Caesar,
Pompeius, and Crassus (the principum of v. 4).

7. tractas: this verb governs all the preceding accusatives as
direct objects, except periculosae plenum opus aleae, which stands
in apposition with the sentence as a whole. To write the history
of the Civil Wars was dangerous, because Augustus might easily
be offended, as well as many other notable Romans.

10. theatris: dative.

12. Cecropio: “Athenian‚’' from Cecrops, a legend-ary king of
Attica, where all the greatest tragedians were bred. The cothurnus
was a buskin or thick-soled shoe, worn by tragic actors to increase

their height.
