202 nomen, onus 111., 8.

2. velint: “ what is the meaning oi,'’ a common sense of volo.
acerra : a small casket in which the incense (tiis) used at sacrifices
was kept. turis : objective genitive with plena.

4. vivo : “ fresh.” Altars which were not intended for permanent-
use were commonly made of sods of turf.

5. sermones : retained accusative after the passive docte, the active
voice governing two accusatives. Cp. vi. 21, η. utriusque linguae ε
Greek and Latin, the only two languages which a Roman cared to
know. Sermones, usually ‘⁶ discourses,’' is here used in the sense of
“ traditions.’' The point is that Maecenas, being a student of such
matters, will wonder what rite, Greek or Roman, Horace is keeping
up.

6. voveram ε “ Ι had vowed ’'; pluperfect, because the vow was
anterior to the preparations he is describing. Epulae, -mum, denotes

‘⁴ a sumptuous meal,‘’ “ a banquet ”; the singular, epulum, -ἰ, is
used of a public banquet.

7. Libero: a name of Bacchus, because he frees men from care.

He was the guardian deity of poets, and Horace therefore regards
him as his preserver from the falling tree. Allusion is made in iv.
27 to this escape.

9. festus: predicative—-“ kept as a festival.'' Anno redaente is
ablative absolute (temporal).

10. pice: wine was stored in large earthenware vessels of con-
siderable girth (amphorae). The neck, which was narrow, was closed
by a cork, and further sccurcd with pitch. A label was attached,
bearing the name and the year of the vintage3 and the whole was
finally stored in the apotheca, a small closet so constructed that the
draught from the furnaces which warmed the house and baths passed

amongst the amphorae. Hence sumum bibere. The warmth hastened
the maturity of the wine.

ll. bibere : instituo, meaning “ to teach,'' takes the infiin'tive.

12. consule Tullo: ablative of attendant circumstance (ablativo
absolute). The Romans dated the year by the name of one or both
of the consuls for that year. Volcatius Tullus was consul in 66 13.c.,
so that this wine was vinted in the year before Horaee’ birth.

13. cyathos ε the cyathus was a long-handled cup used for ladling
out the wine with the proper proportion of water, since wine was
never or very rarely drunk pure. amici: genitive of the person
whose health is drunk. It may be an imitation of the same con-
struction in Greek, or possibly in both languages it is a natural
extensior] of the possessive genitive: “your friend's cup ” being
equal to “ a cup in honour of your friend.'’

15. in lucem: “ prolong till dawn,⁷‘ i.e. keep them buming all
night, sit up all night. A Roman drinking-bout followed the coena

which began about 6 p.m. Lamps would be required before it was
over. Cp. luminibuS, vi. 28.
