(s) The Fourth Archiloohjan couplet begins with four
daotyls, for the first three of which spondees may be sub-
stituted; as the rest of the measure oonsists of feet os
three times, the dactyls should be regarded as cyolio and
the spondeos as irrational.

(i) The mette called Ionicum α minore oonsists entirely

of the foot of the same name (υ υ ι ..) ; it occurs only in
III. 12. Tho division of this Ode into verses, as in the

text, is customary, but rests on no certain authority.
