ARGUMENT.—Why weep for Gyges ? The winds of sprinq will
brinq him back to thee, and he is loyaz, and as impatient of detay as
thyself. M any are his temptations, but he withstands them, nor listens
to the prom ptinqs of Chloe's messenyer. And do thou prove as constant .·
beware of Enipeus' skill and strenqth, ancl take no heed of his serenadinq.

1. Asterie : a fancy name, like that of Gyges, v. 5. The relative
quem refers to quen (v. 5), which is the object of fles. Beatum is
predicative with restituent, and means “ rich‚” as often in Horace;
while iuvenem is in apposition with quen. candidi: “ clear,'' i.e.
“ cloudless,'’ as compared with the south wind which brings rain-
clouds.

4. fide : an old form of the genitive fidei. Similarly we have die
for diei. The genitive is one of quality.

5. Gygen : the form is a Greek accusative. Gyges is supposed to
be a merchant, weather-bound on his homeward Journey.

6. post: “after the risinq of’' the star. Capra, more usually
called Capella (the Goat), is the brightest star in the constellation

11. ignibus : there are two ways of taking the words tais iynibus ε
(i) ‘⁶ a love like yours‚'' “the passion that is yours,⁷’ iqnes being
common in this sense; (2) ‘⁴ the object of your love,'' just as we
speak of so-and-so's flame, meaning the object of his love. Iynis
(singular) is common in this sense, but not so in the plural. The
same metaphor is continued in uri.

12. temptat : sc. quen. Vafer must be translated as an adverb 3
cp. abstinens, v. 18 ; fallax, v. 20.

13. ut: “ how ’³ (cp. iv. 17), introducing the indirect question
with verb inpulerit in the subjunctive, depending upon refert.
mulier : Antea. See Index, s.v. BELLEROPHONTES.

16. maturare: the prose construction would be ut maturaret, as
usual with verbs of forcing. Bellerophontae is a dative of indirect
object. necem : nex and letum always refer to violent death.

17. Pelea: the form is a Greek third declension accusative.
Tartaro ε see Index.

18. fugit: the quantity ( stt->shows this to be present tense. Dum,
