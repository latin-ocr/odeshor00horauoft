Sea. Hence adj. Cynthius, -a‚ -um, applied to Apollo and Artemis
(Diana), who were born at the foot of Mount Cynthus.

Cyprus, -i, f. (hence adj. Cyprius, -a, —um): the island of this
name in the Eastern Mediterranean. It was the favourite haunt of
Venus, who had a famous temple at Paphos on the W. coast ; and
it gave its name to the surrounding sea (Ι. xiii. l, xxx. 23 ΙΙΙ.
xxvi. 9: etc).

cyrus, -i, m.: the first king of the Persians, and the conqueror of
Babylon and L’y‘dia, which, with Persia and Media, constituted his

D.

Dacus, -i‚ m.: a Dacian. 'she Daci (or Getae) (Ι. xxxv. 93 ΙΙ.
xx. 18.) were a warlike tribe dwelling upon the northern bank of the
lower Danube, now Transylvania‚ Moldavia, Wallachia, etc. They
fought on the side of Antonius at Actium. They frequently made
inroads into the provinces of Moesia, S. of the Danube. This they
did when the river was frozen (3.0. 27), and were repulsed, but with-
out permanent effect, by a certain M. Crassus, one of Augustus’ leqaei
(ΙΙΙ. vi. 14; IV. xv. 21). To say that they “all but destroyed
Rome ” is an exaggeration. They were expert archers (melior
sayictis), and their high morality is extolled in (III. xxiv. 11,soll.).

Daedalus, -i‚ m. (whence the adj. Damoclem, -a, —um), father of

Campania. (1. iii. 34 ; II. xx. 13.)

despot of Syracuse (nc. 405-367). He expressed himself envious
of Dionysius' happy life, whereupon the despot changed places with
him for one evening. In the course of the banquet Damocles looked
up, and found a naked sword suspended over his head by a single
horse hair-a symbol of the anxio-us life of the great (ΙΙΙ. i. 17).

Danae, -es‚ f. : the daughter of Acrisius, king of Argoa. Learning
that he would be slain by any son born of his daughter, he immured
her in a brazen tower, where, however, Zeus (Jupiter) visited her in
a shower of gold, which fell through the roof. Danae's son, Perseus,
fulfilled the oracle by slaying his grandfather. Horace rationalises
the story of the shower of gold (III. xvi. 1).

Danaus, -i‚ m. ε a mythical person who gave his fifty daughters in
marriage to the fifty sons of Aegyptus, ordering them each to slay
- her husband on the night of her bridal. All did so save Hypermnestrs„

condemned to spend eternity in the attempt to fill with water a sieve
or a jar (ΙΙΙ. xi. 27) that had no bottom.
