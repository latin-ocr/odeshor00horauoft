Book I. opens with a dedication to Maecenas and Book ΙΙ.
closes fitly with an Ode on the poet’s immortality, while
there is no special conclusion to Book Ι., or prelude to
Book ΙΙ., Books Ι. and ΙΙ. form a whole in themselves3
and Book III. again is complete in itself, with introduction
and conclusion. This may only mean that the poet had a
special purpose in Book III., and does not prove a separate
or later publication.

All three Books refer generally to some well-known
events; thus Horace is in possession of his Sabine farm,
which was given him by Maecenas about 33 B.c.
(I. 173 II. 13, 18; III. 13, 16); the civil wars are over
(31 Bc), but the empire has not yet settled down again
after the confusion (I. 2, 35 ; ΙΙ. 1, 6; ΙΙΙ. 6) ; Augustus,
first so called in 27, is entering upon the path of reform
(Ι. 12; ΙΙ. 15, 16; ΙΙΙ. 1-6, 24); and wars in Spain
(ended in 19 B.c.), Parthia (ended in 20), and Scythia
(ended much later) are still being waged (I. 2, 12, 19, 29,
35; ΙΙ. 2, 6, 9, 11, 13, 16; III. 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 29). But
only in the few following Odes can any approximation be
made to a definite date.

In Book Ι. we may place Ode 12 between 25 and 23 B.c.,
the date of the adoption of Marcellus by Augustus and the
date of his death ; and the Book would certainly not have
been published with this Ode aster the death of Marcellus.
Ode 24 must have been written in 24 B.c., when Quintilius
Varus died, and Ode 18 consequently earlier; Ode 31 in
28, when the temple of Apollo was opened; and Ode
37, the earliest, in September, 30, on the death of
Cleo iatra.

InI Book ΙΙ., Ode 1 belongs to 30 or 29 B.c., before
the civil wars were quite ended3 Ode 2 falls between
25, when Phrahates was restored to the throne of Parthia,
and 23, the year in which Murena, the brother
of Proculeius, joined the conspiracy of Fannius Caepio
against Augustus, for which he was executed in 22:
this Ode and 10, and III. 19, would not have been pub-
lished aster this conspiracy was discovered, so that this
