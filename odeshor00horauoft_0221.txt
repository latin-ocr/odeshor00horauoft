NOTES. 213

26. arat: the final syllable is long (ὰ), although followed by a
vowel. Other instances occur in xxiv. 5 (fiqil), and in Ode v. 17, if
the reading periret be adopted. Ανᾰι and periret are instances, not
of the lengthening of a short vowel, but of the retention of the
original long quantity; cp. the corresponding passive forms.

29. purae. . . aquae: genitive of material, expressing “ that of
which a thing consists.” So iuyerum, which is a plural of the third
declension, though the singular is iuqerum, -ἰ,

32. fallit sorte beatior: for the singular verb after a composite
subject, cp. risisset, v. 7. Sorte is ablative of respect, ‘⁴ in lot,” “ as
a lot.” With beatior a participle meaning “ being ” would be joined,
if such existed in Latin, the Greek construction of which this is an
imitation being λανθάνει αὐτὸν μακαρτέρα οὖσα, lit. “ escapes his
notice being happier‚'' i.e. “is happier though he does not perceive
it (who glitters . . . ).” Fulqentem (equivalent to eum qui sulqet) is,
of course, the direct object of fallit.

33. ferunt ι sc. ad me.

34. Bacchus: i.e. vinum. amphora: see viii. 10, n.

38. velim . . . deneges : the form of the sentence (present subjunc-
tive in protasis and apodosis) indicates a supposition relating to
future time and dependent on a condition the truth or falsity of
which is not implied.

39. cupidine : in Horace cupido is always masculine. Vergil and
other writers make it feminine as a rule, masculine only when used
as the name of the god of love, Cupid.

40. vectigalia ε “ revenues.'' The word properly means any such
taxes as arise from customs-dues, rent of public properties, ete„ as
distinct from tributum paid by a subject people.

42. petentibus: dative with desunt, as usual with a compound
of sum.

43. benest : = bene est. Supply ei as antecedent to cui. Est
is here used impersonally : “it is well with him.'‘

A MESSAGE 'ro AELIUS LAmA, A mem or HORACE.
AnomNT.—Descendant—for such they say you and your family
are—of Lamus, the old-time king] of Formiae, ’twill rain to-morrow‚
and you and your slaves will have to stay at home ‚· so yet in dry wood
that you may be merry.
[See Index for Formiae, Lamus, Liris, Marica.]

l. Aeli: for the form of the vocative, cp. Mercuri, xi. l, n. ab
Lamo : “ from,⁷’ i.e. “ descended from Lamus.''

2. hinc : i.e. ab Lamo. The qens Lamia, to which Aelius belonged,
traeed their family and name to the Homeric Lamus. For ferunt,
see on fertur, v. 41. Esse must be understood with denominatos.
