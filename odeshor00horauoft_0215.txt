No‘rrs. 207

29. manent: used (as here) as a transitive verb, maneo means
“to await.'' It is most commonly absolute, “ to remain ”3
occasionally, intransitive with the dative, “to be reserved for.''

30. potuere ε without infinitive, as possent, iv. 58. Possum ι like
debeo, decet, etc„ is regularly put in the indicative (rather than
subjunctive) in the apodosis of a condition of known falsity, even
where (as here) the protasis is suppressed: “ What greater thing
could they have done (if they had wished) ? ’⁵ In v. 31, potuere has
the rather unusual sense of ‘⁴ had the heart to.''

33. una: Hypermnestra alone out of the fifty. See Index, sxv.
DANAUS. face: ablative with diqna. The bride was escorted to
her husband’s house by torchlight after dusk.

35. splendide mendax: oxymoron. See vii. 22, n.
38, ne : final—“ in order that . . . not.” The lonqus somnus is, of

course, death. unde ε as commonly, the antecedent adverb (alicunde,

“from some quarter ”) must be supplied in translating—-“ from a
quarter, whence.”

45. oneret : jussive, as audiat, v. 25. So releqet, v. 48.

47. vel: “ even.” When not introducing an alternative, vel has
this meaning.

50. secundo : originally a participle of sequor, used with an active
force in the sense of “following ’⁷ ; cp. oriundas, ‘⁶ springing.“
Hence either (1) “ second,’⁷ as being what follows; or (2) “ favour-
able,'’ as here, like a wind which follows and helps a ship. The
ablative is one of attendant circumstance. Cp. alite luqubri, in'. 61,
and the whole note there.

51. nostri memorem : “ that is (shall be) mindful of me.'' Nostri
is objective genitive, as always; the use of the pronoun of the first
personinthe plural with singular meaning is not uncommon. sepulcro :
ablative of the place where without preposition3 see i. 10, n.

ODE XII.
Tm: LAMENT or NEOBI‘JLE‚ wno Lovns IN SEoREr.

1. miserarumst : i.e. miserarum est ; note the gender, and observe
the use of the adjective without a substantive. The genitive is
predicative. dare ludum : exactly the English, “ give play to,'’ i.e.
allow to take its own course.

2. lavere : third conjugation inf. (ν υ ν), not to be confounded with
lavere (3 pl. perf.). See iv. 61, n. metuentes : the participle really
expresses the cause—“ for dread of,⁷' “ because they dread.” Roman
uneles were a proverb for their strietures.
