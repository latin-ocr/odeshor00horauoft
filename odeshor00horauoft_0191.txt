No‘rns. 183

Murena did not escape capital punishment, and Maecenas
was no longer in favour at court. If the date of the con-
spiracy is 22 B.C., after the death of Augustus’ nephew and
heir Marcellus, and if Horace really alludes to it, the date
of publication of Books L-HI. of the Odes must be later
than that usually assumed, viz. 23 B.C.

ODE I.
OF THE ADVANTAGES or Humum AND CONTENTMENT.

ARGUMENT.—I am the poet of the A'il uses, and I bid you listen to my
sonys. There is none that is his own master save J ove .· all others must
bow to Necessity, no matter what their rank or their pursuits. Be content,
then, to lead a quiet life ,· for whoso lives thus *need sear no sword of
Damocles, no stroke of Portam, whereas Fear and Care search out the
lofty and torment them, and their wealth avails them not. Better my
little farm and peace, than wealth and misery.

2. favete linguis: literally ‘⁵ be favourable with your tongues,''
an expression used by Roman priests when commencing a sacrifice.
It was equivalent to a request that none of the bystanders should
utter any word of evil omen, and so mar the ceremony, whence it
means ‘⁶ be silent.'' Horace is speaking as if he were the priest of
the Muses, and as if his Odes were religious. The profanum volyus
means all who cannot appreciate this poetry, because such persons

are “ outside the sanctuary ’' (pro, fanum) of the Muses.

5. timendorum : merely an epithet of, not in gerundival construc-
tion with, regum, which depends upon imperiumst (= imperium est).
Cp. invidendis, v. 45. That over which one’s rule extends is regu-
larly expressed by the accusative with in. greges : metaphorically
= populos.

7. clari : attributive to Iovis, as is moventis. The adjective
G'iyanteo stands in lieu of de Εέἰςγαηιθίὁαε-ιζ triumph over the Giants.'’

8. supercilio : “ frown,” lit. ‘⁴ eyebrow.” Homer says all Olympus
(Heaven) shakes when Zeus (Jupiter) nods or frowns.

9. †est ut: “it is possible that‚'’ “it may be that.” The con-
secutive subjunctives, ordinet, descendat, contendat, sit, all depend
upon ut. Some editors read esto—‘⁶ let it be that,'' ‘⁴ granted that?
viro: ablative of the standard of comparison, with latius, which
means “ to a greater extent,’⁷ i.e. one has larger vineyards than

another.
