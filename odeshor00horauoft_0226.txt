storest choice (lectum) Massic. ” Nomen has the meanings of“ title,”

“pretextst “account” ‘ssreason 'all traceable to the primary sig-
nification ‘⁴ namess 'and denoting a classification under a heading
or name. With Massicum supply vinum; so in English we speak
of‘ ‘”port or “ port wine.'’

6. moveri: prose would require quae movearis (consecutive sub-
junctive), but the infinitive is frequent in poetry.

Descende is the main verb of the sentence which occupies the first
two stanzas.

8. promere: the proper word for drawing the wine from the
amphora—“ broaching ” a new jar.

9. madet: “is soaked in.'' The word is frequently applied to
drunkenness, and there is a play on that meaning here.

10. sermonibus : ‘⁴ discourses,” referring especially to Plato’s
Dialogues, in which Socrates takes the leading part. horridus ι the
word originally means “ bristling,'' and so applied to character it
denotes “ blunt,” “ churlish.’'

λύω, “ I loose ’' ; cp. the Latin luo, “ Ι discharge (a debt).”

18. viresque et: the -que joins this line with the preceding; the
et couples vires and cornua. The metaphorical use of “ horns '’ for
‘⁴ power ” is familiar to most of us from the Hebrew Scriptures.

19. post te ε i.e. “ after (he has drunk of) thee.” Trementi agrees
with pauperi, and is here used transitively, the idea of “ trembling '’
being extended to that of “ dreading.’'
