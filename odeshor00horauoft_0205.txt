42. ut capitis minor : “ as one that was no more a citizen? Caput
is the technical word for legal personality, i.e. all the rights, liberties,
and powers which belong to a citizen. If he lost any of these, he
was said to suffer diminutio capitis, or to be capite diminutus This
is what Horace means. Loss of rights might arise from a conviction
in thelaw courts, or from voluntary exile, as in Regulus' case. The
genitive capitis is the genitive denoting the point in which the
adjective is applicable; cp. linquae ferox, “ violent in speech.’' This
use of the genitive is found only in poets and later prose writers ; it
falls under the general heading of adjectiva] genitive.

44. torvus ε represented in English by an adverb, like iners, v. 36.
humi ε locative.

45. patres : “ senators,” because the original Senate was made up
of such as were heads of families.

46. firmaret: subjunctive, as expressing his purpose. So pro-
peraret. auctor: properly “ one who promotes the existence or

increasing of a thing ''; here, the “ giver '² of the advice. Alias
is an adverb.

49. sibi : referring, of course, to the subject of the principal verb
sciebat. Se is regularly so used in dependent clauses which are final
(i.e. denote purpose), or contain an indirect question (as here), or a
reported statement.

53. quam si : resuming non aliter—“ just as iffi For clientes, see
note on i. 13, and observe the unusual form of the genitive plural
(contrast clientium in i. 13), the rule being that substantives with
bases ending imtwo consonants have genitive plural in —ium.

54. relinqueret : another case of the suppression of the apodosis;
cp. v. 17, si periret. In fun we should have non aliter dimovit quam
dimoveret si relinqueret. The imperfect subjunctive implies that the
hypothesis is contrary to fact, something ‘⁵ untrue in the present.”

56. Lacedaemonium : Tarentum was colonised from Lacedaemon
(Sparta). See Index, av. TARENTUM.
