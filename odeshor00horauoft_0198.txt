190 HORACE, ODEs 111„ 3.

37. saeviat: the subjunctive, as also in insultet and celent, is final,
fici} eofflgles’ses purpose, and dum is to be rendered “ provided that,”
39. beati z predicative—“ rule and prosper.” So Ῑῑιίρεηε, v. 43.

42. stet: jussive subjunctive. So possit, v. 43, extendat, v. 46.
Capitolium: the Capitol is the most western of the seven hills of
Rome. It stands immediately upon the bank of the Tiber, and was
surmounted by the great sanctuary of Jupiter Capitolinus.

43. triumphatis ε “ who have been triumphed over.'’ The usage
is irregular because triumpho, being an intransitive verb, cannot
properly be used in the passive except impersonally; ep. i. 45, n.

44. dare iura : “ lay down the law for.”

45. late z with horrenda.

46. medius liquor : τῖε. the Straits of Gibraltar.

47. Europen : Greek accusative, from a nominative Europe.

49. This stanza depends as an adjectival clause upon Roma, the
subject understood with the main verb (extendat, v. 46). The order
is : [Roma extendat nomen] fortior spernere aurum . . . quam coyere
(aurum) in humanos usus dextra rapiente omne sacrum. The clause
cum terra celat explains melius situm. Dextra is ablativo of the
instrument with coqere, and omne sacrum is the object of rapiente.
The meaning is that Rome’s success is to depend upon her being
more seornful than careful of money-making.

50. spernere fortior : “ braver in scorni11g‚'' or (more literally)
‘⁸ braver for the purpose of scorning.'' The infinitive both in Greek
and in Latin was originally in most of its forms the dative of a
verbal noun, and as such may denote an action to which that of the
main verb is directed, or for which it takes place (eg. laborat trepidare,
‘⁴ toils to hasten on ''), or an aetion for which the quality expressed by
an adjective exists (eg. celer sequi, ‘⁶ quick to follow‚'' ‘⁴ quick for
following '’). Horace employs the construction somewhat freely;
but in prose, for spernere sortior, we should have sortior in spernendo.

54. hunc : sc. terminum, the substantive being expressed, as often.
in the relative, instead of in the antecedent clause. For tangat, cp.
stet, v. 42.

55. †qua parte debacchantur : with this reading the construction
is gestiens visere (eam partem) qua parte iques debacchantur. But
there is another reading debacchentur, a dependent question, and if
this be adopted the meaning is “ to see in what region the fires revel.'''
ignes : of the sun ; the reference is to tropical lands.

58. hac lege: “ on this condition ”; a common meaning of lex.
The ablative is one of manner. What the condition is, is expressed
by the following final clause ηε . . . velint, the usual construction
after a verb of comma-nding. Nimium belongs both to pii and
fidentes.
