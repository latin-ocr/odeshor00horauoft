RATH.

Amnmsm—Talae care, Pyrrhus. Y ou are dealing] with α lioness ‚-
and when she meets you, it will 90 hard with you. The prize is not

1. moveas : quanto introduces a dependent question. The
ablative, quanto periclo, is one of manner.

3. post paullo z “ soon afterwards,” lit. “ afterwards by a little.”
Post is an adverb, as often ; paullo is ablative of measure.

6. ibit : the English idiom renders this future by a present tense.

7. certamen ε accusative in apposition to the preceding sentence,
i.e. the contest consists in her “going ” (ibit). A substantive so
placed is nominative or accusative, according as it is more closely
connected in thought with the subject or with the object of the
sentence. The following double indirect question depends on the

“ greater,” but the meaning must be “ whether the prey fall to thee
or rather to her.’' The difficulty has given rise to the conjecture illa

main clause beginning with arbiter.

12. palmam : the symbol of victory.

13. fertur: cp. v. 41, rt. Observe the difference in the tenses of
posuisse and recreare.

16. raptus ε viz. Ganymedes, son of Tros, and brother of Ilus the
founder of Troy. He was carried off from Mount Ida by an eagle
to be cupbearer to Zeus (Jupiter).

thou art, I know, well worthy of my quest Messala, and he is a qood
judqe for all his learninq, as was stern old Cato. Wine makes the
touque way, the anxious careless, the poor man bold. Come down,
then, and we will keep thee circulatim till dawn.
