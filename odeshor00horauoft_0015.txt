Horace only imitated him in celebrating the event in poetry.
He wrote, in the Aeolio dialect, hymns, political songs, love
songs, and especially drinking songs. Alcman also flourished
in the closing half of the seventh century B.c. He was a
Lydian slave brought to Sparta, where he obtained his free—
dom, and founded a school of Dorio lyric poetry. He wrote
six books of poems containing hymns, pacans, love songs,
songs for maidens, and drinking songs.

Archilochus, an Ionian, the son of a slave-woman, was
born at Paros in the latter half of the eighth century B.0.
He lived a wandering life, went with a colony to Thasos,
where in battle he too threw away his shield, visited Sparta,
where he was now allowed to remain, and returned at last to
Paros to be slain in battle. He was betrothed at one time
to Neobfile, daughter of Lycambes, but, being jilted, replied
with a satire so scathing that Neobfile and Lycambes hanged
themselves. His nature was like gall and his pen charged
with poison. He is one of the greatest of Greek poets, and
introduced into literature not only satire, but also iambic
and trochaic metres. His style is perfect. Asclepiades was
a native of Samos, and a poet of the Alexandrine school of
the second century B.c.

Hipponax, an imitator os Archilochus in the use of
satire written in iambic verse, was born at Ephesus in
the early part of the sixth century B.0. He was banished
to Clazomenae by the despots of Ephesus, Athenagoras and
Comas, and is best known for his encounter with two
sculptors of Chios, Bupalus and Athenis ; they ridiculed his
unprepossessing appearance3 he replied with satire, and
Bupalus hanged himself. He wrote in Ionic and invented
scazon, or “ limping '' iambic verse.

Pindar, the greatest of Greek lyric poets, was born at
Thebes about 520 B.0.‚ where he lived the greater part of
his life 3 he found great patrons in Alexander of Macedon,
Arcesilaus of Cyrene, and especially Theron os Agrigentum
and Hieron of Syracuse. He died at Argos in 422 B.c.
