10 INTRODUCTION.

On two points a word may be said : Horace’s choice of
words and phrases, and his arrangement of matter. We
have noticed the artist in his arrangement of the Odes.
The artist is equally seen in these two points.. His phrases
are terse, pointed, clear, and simple: he is one of the
world' s greatest masters of expression. His arrangement
is marked by self- -repression and characteristic 1r0ny. He
deprecates elevation and didactics while using them, and
apologises for lofty flights by rebuking his muse. Impor-
tant themes are often introduced by allegories, or as if
unintentionally‚ and a serious thought is rounded off into
lightness. He is always vigorous, healthy‚ and interesting.

§ 9. Prosody.—The metres used by the classical Latin
poets are all of Greek origin, and depend entirely on
quantity, zze. on the length of a syllable. A syllable con-
tains either one vowel or a diphthong : any syHable con-
taining a diphthong 01· long vowel is a long syllable, and a
syllable containing a short vowel is a short syllable unless
two consonants (see Rule 3 below) foHow the vowel. Thus—
ὅε, “ bone‚” has genitive οεεῖε, in which the first syllable is
long on account of the position of ο before ss, although the
ο is naturally short, as is seen by the nominative.

The following rules are sufficient for the leamer’s guidance
in reading verse, but are nearly all subject to some few

double consonants x, z, or by semi· -consonant i (sometimes
