A verse consists of a certain number of feet, all the feet
in any one verse being theoretically of the same length,
i.e. each foot contains the same number of short syllables or
their equivalent, the short syllable (ν) being adopted as the
unit of measurement, and counting as one “ time.”

The necessity of a system of scansion which recognises
uniformity in the length of the feet of a verse arises from
the fact that metre originated with songs, and that feet
correspond to bars of music, which must be of uniform
length so long as the same “ time ’' is maintained.

A long syllable (-) has normally the value of two times.
In certain positions, however, a long syllable takes the place
of a short syllable; it is then called “ irrational,'' and is
denoted by the sign > .

Again, a long syllable may have the value of three or of
four times: in the former case it is denoted by ; the
latter value does not occur in any of the metres to be
explained here.

The feet found in the Odes of Horace are :—

Of three times: trochee (ί υ ), irrational trochee (Δ > ),
and syncopated trochee (ι-) ;
oyclic dactyl* (ίυ υ) ;
iambus( υ J) and irrational iambus ( > -l ).
Of four times : dactyl (ί υ υ) ;
spondee ( Δ - ). Ι
Of six times ionicus a minore (υ υ ·- - ).

The sign (t) indicates the position of the ictus or metrical
stress3 this must not be confused with the word-accent,
with which it may or may not coincide. In the following
metrical schemes it can easily be supplied from the above
list of feet, but the relative strength of the ictus in different
parts of the verse was by no means the same and cannot be
dctermined with certainty ; it must have varied in accord-
ance with the requirements of rhythm and sense.

Many verses begin with an introductory syllable (known
as the “ anacrusis ''), which does not form part of the system

* In a cyclic dactyl the long syllable and the first short syllable
together have the value of two times.
