1. nubibus: ablative of place whence motion takes place. It is
unusual for it to stand without a preposition.

7. Gargani z the Mons Garganus forms a headland on the Adriatic
Sea in the north of Apulia.

8. foliis : the ablative may be explained as one of either separa-
tion or respect.

9. modis: “ measures '⁹ (musical), zze. elegies ; so amores in v. 11
means love-poems. Gaius Valgius Rufus was an elegiae poet of
Maecenas’ circle.

10. Mysten ademptum ι cp. ademptus Hector, iv. 10, η. Vespero :
the planet Venus, which does not “ rise '⁷ in the eveniug, though it
may then become visible.

12. fugiente solem: i.e. when Venus is a morning star.

14. senex ι Nestor, king of Pylos in Messenia, lived through three
generations of men, and was the wisest counsellor of the Greeks
before Troy. His son Antilochus was slain by Memnon while
defending his father.

16. Troilon: Troilus was son of Priam and Hecuba3 lie was
slain by Achilles while still a mere lad. He had fifty sisters, here
called Phrygian, because the Troad was a portion of Phrygia.

18. querellarum: this use of the genitive is a Graecism, the
regular Latin construction requiring the accusative. nova . . .
tropaea: the reference is probably to some monument erected in
25 B.o. to celebrate victories gained over various barbarous tribes.

name of a mountain of Armenia.

21. Medum flumen: the Euphrates, which Augustus constituted
the boundary between the Roman Empire and the Parthians. The
construction here changes, and an accusative and infinitive clause is
put as object in place of the simple accusative (tropaea . . . Ni-
phaten). Translate: “Sing of the trophies, etc. . . . and how the
Median stream . . . rolls lesser eddies down.''

23. praescriptum : neuter adjective used as a substantive.
Gelonos: the Geloni were a Scythian tribe dwelling about the
Tanais (Don). They are here put loosely for the Dacians, who were

24. exiguis: the plains are called “narrow,'‘ in contrast with
the wide area of Thrace, which the Geloni had once occupied.
