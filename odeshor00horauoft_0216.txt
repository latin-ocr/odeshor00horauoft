208 HORACE, onas 111„ 12, 13.

3. patruae: adjective, from the substantive patruus, ‘⁴ unele.'’

4. Cythereae: Index, av. anns. qualum: object of aufert, to
be supplied from the next line. The change of subject from puer to
nitor would be harsh, did not “ Cupid ” and “ Hebrus’ beauty '' both
express, from different points of view, the origin of her passion.
puer ales : Cupid ; ales is here an adjective (contrast iii. 61). telas ,ε
“ webs '' ; weaving was a regular occupatiori of women.

7. unctos : before taking athlctic exercises—quoit-throwing,
wrestling, etc.—the young Romans rubbed their limbs with oil.
After the exercises came the plunge in the Tiber ; cp. vii. 27. Simul
is for simul ac, as often in Horace. lavit: perfect (ᾱ); see v. 2,
above. The subject of lavit is Hebrus, understood from nitor Hebri.

8. pugno : ablative of cause ; so pede. The adjective sequi must
be taken with both nouns.

10. apertum: as a substantive—“ open country‚’' “the open.”
See on altum, i. 34. agitato grege: ablative of attendant circum-
stances, like laxo arcu, viij. 23.

11. iaculari: the infinitive is constructed prolatively with catus,
as excipere with celer. See the note on spernere fortior, iii. 50.

12. excipere : to “receive ” it, as it breaks cover. fruticeto :
nouns in -etum signify “ a place where so-and-so grows‚'’ e.g. dumetum
(from dumuS, ‘⁶ bramble '⁷), quercetum (from quercus, “ oak ”).

ODE XIII.
AN ADDREss 'ro A Banu-mm. Srnmo.

ARGUMENT.—To-morrow I will do sacrifice in thine honour with
a kid, for thy perennial coolness ,· and my poetry shall make thy name
famous for ever.

l. Bandusiae : genitive of material, cxpressing that of which the
thing consists, as in English we say “ the city of London.” The
more usual construction is apposition—fous Bandusia.

2. non sine floribus : ‘⁴ and with flowers ’' ; see vi. 29, u.

3. haedo: donare (active) is constructed like dare (accusative of
thing, dative of recipient), but may also take an accusative of the
person to whom, an ablative (instrumental) of the thing which is
given3 cp. in English“ to present a person with a thing’' In the
passive form of this construction the person becomes the subject,
and the ablative of the thing' 1s retained.

4. cui : dative of indirect object with destinat (v. 5).

6. tibi ε “in thine honour,'' a common meaning of the dative of
advantage.

8. suboles ε i.e. the kid (haedus) above mentioned.

10. nescit tangere ε object infinitive; cp. vii. 25, η.

11. vomere ε with sessis, as ablative of cause. Oxen are used for
ploughing in all parts of Europe.
