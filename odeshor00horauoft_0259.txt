Norns. 251

14. maior: sc. natu, “elder‚” i.e. Tiberius. The younger was
Drusus.

17. spectandus ε “ so notable in war’s strife for the greatness of
the overthrow wherewith he wearied,'’ etc. The construction of
spectandus quantis satiyaret is best regarded as the passive form of
that explained in the note on v. 7 above, the active form being
something like operae pretium est illum spectare, quantis . . .

18. liberae: a “free death '' is such a death as free men die.

21. exercet: “stirs up.’' Pleiadum: the Pleiades (“sailing'')
are seven stars which rise in May and set in October. Their rising
and setting marked the times when winter’s storms ceased and
began, and were the limits of the Roman sailing season.

25. tauriformis : “like a bu11.” Rivers were represented in art
as horned figures either because of their roaring like bulls, or
because of their branching like the horns of a bull.

29. ut: answering to sic, v. 25. 30. ferrata: “mail-clad.”

31. metendo: cp. putando, xi. 30.

33. te : Augustus, who, as Emperor, alone possessed the control
of all the Roman armies (imperium), and who alone could take the
auspices. i.e. perform the sacrifices which were necessary to win the
favour of heaven for any military undertaking. Divos praebente
means that Augustus, in taking the auspices on this occasion, found
the gods favourable, and sc, as it were, lent them (i. e. their favour)
to his deputy, Tiberius. The taking of the auspices involved the
offering of a sacrifice to Jupiter in the Capitol, and the observation
of the signs or omens attendant upon the sacrifice. Op. v. 16.

34. quo die: “on the day when,'' ile. on the same day of the
year; but there is no need to suppose that Horace is exact here.
The allusion is to the entry of Augustus into Alexandria, the
capital of Egypt, after his victory at Actium, 31 Rc.

36. vacuam z it was “ deserted '' because its queen Cleopatra had
committed suicide, like Antonius, after their defeat at Actium.

37. lustro : see note on i. 6. Three lustra = fifteen years :
therefore this Ode was written 16 B.O.

40. imperiis: here “campaigns '' ; as we speak of a man ‘⁶ hold-
ing commands,'' i. e. acting as a commender. adrogavit z “ conferred
in addition”; the word is probably meant as the counterpart of
prmoyare, “ to prolong a command.''

42. Medus: see Index, sv. PARTHUS.

43. tutela: “warden’' (tutor), abstract for concrete. Contrast
its use in vi. 33. Here it is active, “ one who guards ’² ; there it is
passive, “one who is guarded.'’ praesens: lit. “present,'' and so
“ present to bless.'’

45. qui: the relative is made to precede its grammatical ante-
cedent, N ilus. The sources of the Nile were unknown until late in
the nineteenth century.

49. funera: ‘⁶ death.'' The Gauls had a great reputation for
valour ; moreover, the Druids taught them to look forward to a life
after death.
