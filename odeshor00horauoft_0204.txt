196 HORACE, ones 111„ 5.

13. hoc: direct object of caverat, which is here transitive, as in
cave canem, “ beware the dog ! ”

15. †exemplo trahenti: with this conjecture, exemplo is dative
coordinate with condicionibus, after dissentientis. The “ precedent
which was drawing ruin upon the ages to come '’ was the ransoming
of the captive Romans. If the soldiers found that Rome would
ransom them, they would no longer prefer death to surrender. The
MSS. have trahentis, coordinate with dissentientis. Exemplo is then
ablative of the source, and trahentis means ‘⁶ (mentally) extending to
fut-ure ages the evil.’' Trahenti or trahentis represents the apodosis
to which si non periret is the protasis—“ would have drawn . . . if
they had not perished.''

17. periret inmiserabilis : periret here retains the original quantity
of the e in the last syllable ; cp. arat, xvi. 26.

20. sine caede: “without bloodshed,” “ without a blow‚’' with
derepta. Arma here means “ shields‚'’ as often. Soldiers could not
lose their shields, nor citizens suffer bondage, without incurring
lasting disgrace. dixit: inquit or ait is generally used when the
exact words are quoted.

22. tergo : ablative of place—-“ on (i.e. behind) their backs.''
23. portas . . . arva ε of the Carthaginians.

24. marte: here used as a common noun, “ warfare‚'’ and con-
structed as an instrumental ablative. Otherwise, either the ablative
with α or ab, or the dative of the agent, would be required after
populata.

25. repensus : equivalent to a conditional clause, si repensus erit³
cp. renascens, iii. 61. Scilicet (i.e. scilicet, “know, it is permitted”)
usually introduces a sarcastic asscrtion. Acrior is predicative.

27. damnum z i.e. the loss of the money paid in ransom, because
the soldier would not prove worth the price. colores : the whiteness

which it had before it was altered by dyes (medicata). Fucus is
literally “seaweed ''; then the “ dye’' got from it; and finally any dye.

34. marte : “ war.'’ Cp. v. 24, η. In the Second Punic War (218-
ggiinglg.) the Romans did crush Carthage‚ after sixteen years of

36. iners : see the note on libens, iv. 29.

37. sumeret: subjunctive in indirect question dependent upon
inscius. Sumeret is the oblique form of the actual words unde
sumam ,9 “ Whence am I to win life ? '’

38. duello : duellum is an old form of bellum.

40. ruinis: ablative of instrument—‘⁴ exalted by Italy’s ruin '';
cp. robustus militia, ii. 2.

41. fertur : ‘⁴ he is said,'' a very common use of the passive offero

in the third person. So the active ferunt often means “ men say.’'
The subject is of course Regulus, as fertur is not impersonal.
