Lepidus, who was in command in Spain, they took the
title of triumviri reipublicae constituendae.

Meanwhile Julius Caesar’s assassins, the self-styled
“ liberators,'’ had fled to the East, where in 42 B.c. they
were defeated at the battle of Philippi by Antonius and
Octavian. By a treaty made in 40 B.c. Lepidus was put
in charge of Africa, Antonius of the East, and Octavian of
the West of the Empire.

The chief Asiatic power threatening the Roman Empire
was Parthia, and Antonius undertook against it a campaign,
which was on the whole unsuccessful. Another danger to
Rome in the East was the connection of Antonius with
Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, for whom he had deserted his
wife, the sister of Octavian.

Meanwhile Octavian had been strengthening his position
in Rome. In 32 B.c. he found himself able to break with
Antonius, and he defeated him at the naval battle of
Actium in the following year.

It was now time for Octavian to bring to an end the
period of civil strife, to establish law and order, and to
restore so far as might be to Italy the qualities that the
lawlessness of recent times had almost destroyed. Men
of all parties, realising that the old republican government
was a thing of the past, were ready to support Octavian,
now styled Augustus, in his attempts at reform.

Some see in several passages of these and other Odes
references to a conspiracy to kill Augustus, in which a
leading part was taken by Murena, the brother of Mae enas’
wife Terentia. It 1s supposed that Augustus knewb the
conspiracy, and that this fact was communica ed to
Murena by Maecenas or his wife. ο

According to this view Ode I. was suggested by the
character and actions of Murena, who had, presumably
through a legaey, acquired great wealth. In II. 25, a
reference is seen to the betrayal of confidence by Terentia,
and the mention of the victory of Jupiter over the Titans
in IV. 43 is regarded as nn allegory of the suppression of
the conspiracy by Augustus. ²
