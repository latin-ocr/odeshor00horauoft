ARGUMENT.—The oneet os che two Neros masas a full-yroum eayle’e
awoop, or the atlack osa youny lion ‚· and the Vindelici—l know not
why they wear the Amazon-s’ axe—have felc ιο their coel the full power
of ,qood traininy conjoined ιο qood birth. 'Twae a Nero that defeated
Hasdrubal, and yave to our fortune& α ἰαειίηρ curn sor the better, tile
Hannibal consessed that he came ae a sawn to hunt the wolf. ‘⁴ Like
the lopped oak, or like the Hydra, Rome yachers sreeh elren-(yth from
her wound⁸‚'’ he said ; “she risee superior ιο every disaster, and Ι
own myself defeated. Heaven helpe the Claudii, and they are invin-
cible.''

l. qualem: in a simile (as here) any case of qualis is rendered
“just as.'' When in Latin the object with its enlargement pre·
cedes the verb, it is best to turn the sentence into the passive in
English. ministrum fulminis : the eagle, the bird sacred to Jupiter,
was represented as holding a thunderbolt in his claws.

2. in aves: with reynum. In with the accusative is a common
equivalent for the objective genitive after such nouns as reynum,
imperium.

4. in Ganymede: “in the matter of Ganymede.’'

5-12. The four predicates are (1) olim propulit, (2) iam demere,
(3) mox demisit, (4) nunc eyil. This last and vidit (v. 16) are best
translated as present-perfect (“ has driven . . . has seen ”). Olim,
iam, mox, nunc mark four periods.

15. lacte depulsum: “weaned,” lit. driven from (the lioness’)
milk. It is possible either (l) to make lacte and ubere refer to the
different animals, and to take fulva as meaning the eolour of the
red-deer3 or (2) to explain maliis as the lion‘s dam, and make ab
ubere epexegetie of lacte—“a lion lately weaned from his milk, yea,
from the teat of his tawny dam.'’ The second way, though involv-
ing a cumbrous construction, gives the better sense.

16. novo ε “ young‚'' or “new to bloodshed‚” “ unfleshed.”

18. quibus : render the relative as et eis—“and whence cheir
custom is derived which arms . . .'’ The allusion is obscure.

24. iuvenis: Drusus. revictae: “subdued in their turn (re-).”
ΤΞΊ. Ῥέπει-ηας : Augustus was the step-father of Drusus and

1 emus.

36. bene nata: lit. “ thin (i.e. dispositions) nobly born.”

37. Augustus' step-sons ffilonged to the same family as the
consul who defeated Hasdrubal in 207 B-O.

38. Hasdrubal devictus: in English idiom, “ Hasdrubal's over-
throw.'’ Sosuyatie . . . tenebris (v. 39).

41. adorea : “ victory ” ; en old word derived from ador, ‘⁴ grain ”
or “meal,'' because the soldiem received a largess of it after a
victory.
