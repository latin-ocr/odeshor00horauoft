210 HORACE, onss 111., 14.

suppliants and others performing religious ceremonies. It would
be worn, therefore, by any one engaged in supplicatio, which means
‘⁶ thanksgiving ” in honour of a victory3 and this may account for
the use of the adjective supplex here.

11. expertae: “who have experienced marriage '⁵ (lit. “a hus-
band '’). Distinguish expertus (from experior) and expers (xi. 11),
“having no part in.’' †male inominatis: the reading inominatis
(“ ill-omened”) is a conjecture; if it be adopted, male must be
rendered “ fatally.’' The MSS. have male ominatis, in which male
has the common meaning—st evil omened.” The objection to this
is that it leaves a hiatus (ie. lack of elision) between the two words,
of which there is no other example in Horace. In either case the
sense is the same as in i. 2, favete linquis, where see note.

13. mihi : with verbs of “ taking away ” the person from whom
the thing is taken is sometimes regarded (as here) as the indirect
object and is expressed by the dative.

14. tumultum : the regular word for a rising of the Gauls in Italy
(Gallia Cisalpina), and here denoting “ insurrection '' generally.

17. puer : “ slave,” as often. When banqueting or drinking,
Romans were accustomed to be crowned with flowers and sprinkled
with perfumes.

18. duelli : for the objective genitive, cp. nostri memorem, xi. 51,
n.; and for the form of the word, see Ode v. 38, n. The date is
90 Rc. ; see Index, av. Marsus.

19. qua: the quantity shows that this is not the nominative
singular feminine of the indefinite pronoun quis, but the indefinite
adverb ( originally ablative singular feminine) denoting “ in any way.'’

20. fallere : “ escape the notice of.’' The testa was a general name
for an earthenware vessel, and practically synonymous with cadus
(18), ampliora (viii. ll).

21. properet ι indirect jussive, depending upon dic (“ bid ’'). †As
propero frequently takes the infinitivo, some read cohibere in the
next line, which is easier than cohibente. Nodo cohibente is ablativo
of attendant circumstance (ablative absolute).

24. fiet: for the tense, cp. iv. 29, n. abito: second person,
“ come away.’'

25. albescens: Horace was about forty years of age n0w; else-
where he speaks of himself as praecanus, “ grey before his time.“

26. litium‘: objective genitive. So rixae.

27. ferrem: potential subjunctive, πλε. apodosis with protasis

suppressed—“ Ι should not have borne it (if he had done so).‘'
iuventa: ablative of instrument with calidus.

28. consule Planco : L. Munatius Plancus was consul 42 B.c., the
date of the battle of Philippi (iv. 26). For the construction cp.
consule Tullo, viii. 12.
