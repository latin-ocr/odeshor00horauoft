ODE VI.
A HYMN 'ro APOLLo ΛΝΒ DIANA.

ARGUMENT.—Thou who dost punish the proud touque& aud didst
conquer even fierce Achilles, who would fain have extirpated by force
our Trojan ancescors, protect thy poet, whom thou hast inspired.
Come, boys and maidens, sing] the Ode in honour of your protectress,
Diana the huntress, the yiver os sertility, the queen ofthe night. In
lacer days ye will be proud to say, “I sang] the Secular Hymn os
Horace! ”

occasion Horace received orders 10 write the Hymn, which we know
as his ‘⁶ Carmen Saeculare,” and this Ode is an invocation 1ο Apollo
and Diana 1ο inspire and help him in his task.
