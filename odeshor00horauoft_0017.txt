saries, invitations, and so forth (I. 14, 20, 34, 363 II. 13,

ξ 8. Style.—Horace’s great achievement is 10 have intro-
duced Greek forms and styles 01 poetry with success into
Latium. His poetry is imitation concealed by art. Some
01 1116 odes are clearly experiments in the adaptation 01
Greek metres which he did not think altogether successful ;
others again are close representatione 01 Greek songs. In
drawing comparisons we are hampered by the loss of the
Greek lyric originals; but when we compare Horace with
some of his fellow Latin poets we see with what marvellous
skill he rises above them in this direction. Occasionally
there are Greek constructione, and the references to Greek
literature and mythology are numerous ; but a Roman
would not have felt that 116 was reading mere imitations ε
1116 poet's crucible has in magio wise re-formed his material.
