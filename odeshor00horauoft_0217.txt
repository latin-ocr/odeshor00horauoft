[See Index for Hercules, Plancus, Spartacus.]

1. ritu: “in the fashion of Hercules‚’' who fetched from Gades
(cadiz in Spain) the oxen of Geryon. modo ε “ but lately.'' plebs :
properly plebs means “the commons,” opposed to senators and
knights fieqzfflesl), t{opulus the entire free population : here plebs has
prae ica y e a er meaning.

2. morte : ablative of price. laurum : hay-leaves were the symbol
of victory.

3. The Spanish tribes (Index ε sm. Cantaber) gave so much trouble
that Augustus marched against them in person in 26-25 B.c. His
exertions brought 011 an illness, which was very nearly fatal (morte
venalem). penates : the gods of the family, as lares are the gods of
the hearth. The two are not the same ; but both penates and lares
are frequently used as common nouns meaning “ home ” and
“ hearth,” as here.

5. unico : here best taken as meaning ‘⁵ peerlesS,” not “ single ” ;
it would have been a poor compliment to Livia to say she was no
bigamist. mulier : Livia Augusta, wife of Augustus and mother of
Tiberius, who succeeded his step-father Augustus.

6. prodeat: jussive subjunctive. †divis: “in honour of the
gods ’⁹ ; cp. tibi, xffi. 6, η. There is a variant reading sacris,
‘⁶ sacrifices,’' ablative of instrument3 in which case iustis will have
the meaning of “ proper,'’ as iu iusta leqio, “ a proper (i.e. complete)
legion‚’' iustum proelium, “ a regular battle.” operata : operari
means ‘⁶ to be busied,” ‘⁶ to bestow pains” on a thing (dative), and
is regularly used of the performance of sacred 1'ites3 but the thing
(indirect object) is not expressed, and the word denotes absolutely
“ to sacrifice.” The tense of operata here need not be pressed3 the
meaning is “let her come forth and sacrifice '’ rather than ‘⁶ after
sacrificing.'’

7. soror : Octavia, widow of Marcus Antonius the Triumvir.

8. supplice vitta: Roman women bound their hair with a fillet
(vitta). There was also a special vitta of white wool, worn by
