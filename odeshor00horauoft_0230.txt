from one region to another, as war or exhausted lands impelled them,
carrying their tents, etc„ in their waggonS. rite: ⁴⁶ in their own
fashion.’‘

12. inmetata : “ unmeasured‚'' because, whatever land they tilled,
the entire produce was regarded as common property, and no man
had anything of his very own. Hence the crops were liberae, “ free‚''
“ unbought,” all receiving their portion from the common stock.

14. annua ε members of the tribe took it in turn to cultivate the
necessary quantity of land; but such labour was always regarded as
a grievance, and at the year’s end the year's workers were glad to
get back to the fighting or hunting which occupied the rest of their
time.

15. defunctum: “ he who has ended his (year's) labours.'' The
compounds of funyor take the same case as the simple verb.

16. aequali sorte : “ on like terms,'' ule. for one year and no more.
17. illic : “ in that land ’' of the Getae.

18. temperat z intransitive ; ‘⁶ refrains herself from‚'’ “ is merciful
to.'' Stepmothers have always been proverbially unkind to their
stepchildren.

22. alterius viri: viri is the objective genitive after the verbal
adjective metuens (cp. rixarum metuens, xix. 16). ’

23. certo foedere: best taken as ablative of attendant circum-
stances; “ the marriage tie being indissoluble.'’

24. nefas ι sc. est. Peccare refers to the breaking of the marriage
vow, and may be translated by an abstract noun. The force of aut
is “ transgression is not permitted; or, if they do transgress, the
price is death.'’ pretiumst ι for pretium est.

25. inpias : the regular epithet of ‘⁴ civil '’ war, which was a
violation of the duty of pietas ; see iv. 6, n.

26. tollere ε “ to do away with‚'’ “ remove‚” as in v. 32, sublatam.
Tollo means (l) ‘⁴ to list up '‘ ; hence (2) “ to list up and take away ”;
and (3) ‘⁴ to do away with.”

27. Pater Urbium: the title of Pater, “ Father‚’' was given by
cities to their great benefactore as a mark of esteem: Cicero was
hailed Pater Patriae for saving Rome from CatilIna3 Augustus had
the title conferred on him by the Senate in 2 13.c., though it was often
unoffieially applied to him before that.

28. subscribi statuis ε the subject of subscribi is (as is always the
case with an infinitive following quaerere) the same as that of the
finite verb (quaeret), the meaning being “ if he shall seek to be entitled
beneath (sua) his statues.'’ Subscribi is therefore here a copulative
verb, and pater urbium is the complement.

30. post genitis ε “ to them that are born after.'' Post is an
adverb, as in xx. 3 ; and the dative is that of the “ person judging‚”
which falls under the general heading of dative of the indirect object.
