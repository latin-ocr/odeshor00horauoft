ODE XXIV.

OF THE Evns OF AVARICE.

ARGUMENT.-—Th0u9h a man have all the wealth of Arabia and
India, yet he must bow to Necessity ‚· and the poor Scythian mmad
who carries his all about in one wayyon lives a better life than does
the rich man. The Scythian mother is 9enerous, her heart is pure ,-
and she hands on to her children the rich dou-ry of their parents’ virtue.
With them, impurity is a sin whose waye is death. This is the way
of life which he must restore in Rome who would be called his country's
Father and be held in honour by the yenerations to come.

But nowadays we hate yoodness when we see it, yet reyret it when i!
is flown. Laws avail not when the heart is evil. Avarice is the root
of the wrony—avarice, which stops at nothiny, and makes poverty α
disyrace. We ouyht to cast our wealth away, or yive it to the yozls,
and set about traininy our sons in a sterner school. Look at them J
They cannot sit a horse, much less hunt like men ,· they can but yamble
and play womanish yames. Small wonder, when their fathers set them
such an example of fraud and dishonestffi all lustiny aster quin, and
never satisfied.

conjecture, all the MSS. giving Tyrrhenum, and some of ‘chem
Apulicum3 thus, Tyrrhenum omne tuis et mare Apulieum, “the
whole Tyrrhenian and Apulian Sea.⁷’ The Mare Tyrrhenum is that
which h‘es west of Italy, the Mare Apulicum that which washes the
shores of Apulia (the “ heel '' of Italy). The objection to reading
Apulicum is that its first syllable is long, and the metre requires a
short vowel.

5. figit : the final syllable is long ab the caesura. See on xvi. 26.
