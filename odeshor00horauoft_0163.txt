ODE XXXII.

We are asked for an Ode. Come, lyre of mine .· let us now, if
ever, δίης] ιο Romans such souys as Alcaeus sanq even amid war aml
tempesc—souqs os love aud wine. Y ou brinq pleasure ιο the qod-3 ancl
solace ιο mortals; hear me when I iuvolce you, lyre of mine.

reading vocanti (sc. mihi) must be taken as dative of advantage.
