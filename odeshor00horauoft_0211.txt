NOTES. 203

17. civiles: such as a good citizen (civis) would naturally feel,
and especially one in Maecenas' position.

19. sibi: this will go equally well with infestus or luctuosis or
dissidet, and is probably meant to apply to all three.

23. laxo : “ loose,'’ i.e. “ unstrung.” Lazo arcu is an ablative of
attendant circumstance; campis, ablative of separation, like caelo,
iv. l.

25. qui: “in any way‚'’ adverb of the indefinite pronoun and
adjective, quis, qud, quid. Laborare is “to be in trouble.” The
clause depends on cavere.

26. parce : parco is commonly found with an infinitive in poetry,
but this is not allowed in prose.
