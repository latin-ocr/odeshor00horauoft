ARGUMENT.—I cannot afford costly presents, such as work& of art,
nor do you need them ‚· but you are a judye of verses, 80 I send you
these. After all, poetry can do more to make a man famous chan
any monument sor famous deeds. Ic was so with Scipio, with
Romulus, and many others, even with some who are now amony the
yods.

engaging men of the time.

monly uses a predicative adjective, where English employs an
adverb, in speaking of a person’s bodily or mental attitude while
performing an action.
