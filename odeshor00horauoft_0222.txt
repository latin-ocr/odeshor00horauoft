214 nomon, onns HL, 17, 18.

4. memores ε “ which preserve their memory.” Cp. nostri
memorem, xi. 51. Fasti (no singular) denotes (l) court-days, i.e.
days on which legal business might be transacted; (2) a list of such
days, a calendar ; (3) an official register of events kept by the higher
magistrates.

5. †ducis : so all the MSS. ; but some editors adopt the conjecture
ducit, which makes the passage run more smoothly. If this be
adopted there will be no stop after fastos, and quando will introduce
the two clauses ε (a) ferunt priores Lamias hinc (esse) denominatos3
(b) nepotum qenus omne ducit oriqinem ab illo qui. . . .

7. princeps : predicative, ‘⁶ is said to have been the first to possess.'’

9. late tyrannus: the adverb qualifies, not the substantive, but
the verbal notion (of ruling) in the substantive. Nemus and litus
are the objects to sternet.

12. augur: “ prophet‚'’ one who divines by observing the flight
and notes of birds. There was a board or college of augurs at Rome,
under the control of the Pontifex Maximus, and possessing con-
siderable dignity. They were originally three, the king being one of
them. By the time that Horace wrote they had been gradually
increased to sixteen. With fallit, sc. me.

13. annosa ε crows live to a great age—nine generations, said the
Greeks. potis : so. es. See the note on ix. 2.

14. genium : “ your soul.'' The Romans believed that every man
had his own qenins or “ double,'' which came into being and perished
with him. To this qenins they sacrificed on birthdays. It was not
the same as “ sou1‚” but this word is perhaps the nearest English
equivalent.

16. operum: Cicero uses the ablative opere with solutus; the
genitive here is probably a mere imitation of Greek usage, that
language having no ablative case. Famulus is a “ household slave '’ ;
whence familia, “ the slaves in a household,'' “ the domestics.”
