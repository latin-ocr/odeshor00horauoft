198 nomos, onus HL, 6.

1. maiorum : “ ancestors,” as minores sometimes means “ descen-
dants.’'

2. refeceris : donec here expresses time without any idea of
purpose, and therefore is followed by the indicative ; contrast
firmaret, V. 46. Note the English idiom by which the future-perfect
refeceris is rendered by the present or perfect. Cp. iv. 29, n.

3. aedes: the plural here denotes “temples,’' not “a house.’'
Ivibggtes: “falling ’' into ruins; to be distinguished from Mbantes,

5. dis minorem z “less than (i.e. subject to) the gods.⁷'

6. hinc : from the feeling of humility mentioned in the last line,
as huc is ‘⁶ to the same feeling.’' Refer is constructed alike with
both adverbs, though strictly belonging only to huc. With hinc it
must be translated “ take.'⁷ Some explain hinc and huc as meaning
respectively “from the gods'’ and “to the gods.'' Principium is
here scanned like consilium in iv. 41.

9. bis: for the two occasions, see Index, avv. CRASSUS and
PAconns.

lO. non auspicatos : before leaving Rome to take over the com-
mand of an army, the general offered sacrifice to Capitoline Jupiter,
and took the auspices (auspicia) or omens. If these were favourable,
he marched at once ; if not, he waited until they were so. This act
is expressed by the verb auspicari, so that exercitus auspicatus means
“ an army to which the omens are favourable ’² ; while non auspicatus
or inauspicatae means “for which the omens have not been duly
taken, or are unfavourable.'' Unfavourable omens were supposed
to bode misfortune and the displeasure of the gods ; and conversely,
if an army proved unfortunate, it was supposed that the general had
not duly taken the auspices.

ll. adiecisse : the infinitive depends upon renidet, as if the latter
were a verb of rejoicing. Properly renideo is “ to shine again,'’ “ to
glisten.” It is used here of one who “ glows with pride ” that a
thing has happened.

13. paene : with delevit. occupatam : “ occupied with.’' Occupo
is not common in this sense ; more usually it means ‘⁴ to be the first
to seize '² a thing, or ⁴⁴ to do a thing before some one else.’' The
seditiones alluded to are those which followed the murder of Julius
Caesar, when Octavianus (Augustus), Antonius, and Lepidus were
contending for power. See Index, avo. DAcus, Ammopsx, for the
allusions, which are important.

15. hic . . . ille z ‘⁴ the latter . . . the former.''

17. culpae : adjectives implying “ full of '’ take an objective geni-
tive.

21. motfis: verbs of teaching, which in the active govern two
accusatives, one of the person, the other of the thing, may retain
the latter when they are used in the passive.
