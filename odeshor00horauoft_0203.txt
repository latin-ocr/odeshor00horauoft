ODE V.

OF ’11111 BEAUTY or COURAGE, As EXEMPanmn BY REGULUS.

ARGUMENT.—W e know that Jupiter is the qod os heaven .· Auqustus
shall be held as a qod on earth, when he has completed the conquest
of the world, and avenqed the cowardice of those who bouqht life by
surrenderinq to the Parthians. Requlus foresaw what evils follow upon
cowardice if it be not unpitied, and he spoke to dissuade the Romans
from such pity. “I saw those warriors yield without a struqqle!
Will they fiqht better if you buy thern back ,9 All they care about is
life, not honour.'’ So he spoke, and his advice prevailed,· and he left
wife, and children, and home, to return to the torturer, as yladly as if he
were settinq out for a holiday.

[See Index for Carthago, Crassus, Regulus, Tarentum.]

l. caelo ε ablative 01 place without a preposition. It goes closely
with reqnare. credidimus : “ have come to believe,” i.e. “are
Ξὲἓνῗὲἓξὲὶὲ The perfect denotes that the belief is now complete

2. praesens : ‘⁶ on earth.” The word combines the two notions of
“ dwelling amongst men ” and “ helping men.'’

3. adiectis ι temporal ablative absolute, going closely with
habebitur. Imperio is the dative of the indirect object with adiectis.

4. Persis : Index, s.v. PARTHUS.

5. coniuge barbara. : ablative absolute, to be joined in sense with
turpis maritus—lit. “ a disgraced husband, his wife being (i.e. because
his wife is) a foreigner.’⁷ Barbarus means simply ‘⁵ not Roman.''

6. hostium z the noun is here used as an adjective with socerorum,
which genitive depends upon armis.

7. pro : this line is a parenthesis, i.e. has nothing to do with the
rest of the stanza, and must be translated as if enclosed in brackets.
Pro (or Proh) is an exclamation expressive of indignation, and curia
is 111 the nominative case.

10. anciliorum ε heteroclite (i.e. belonging to another declension)
genitive plural of ancile, the shield of Mars, said to have fallen from
heaven. It was shaped something like the figure 83 and, to avoid
its being stolen, there were made eleven others exactly similar. The
whole dozen were hung up in the temple 01 Mars, under the care of
the Salii (priests 01 Mars). Obliviscor takes the genitive case.
togae : the t09a was the formal dress 01 every Roman in 1115 character
of citizen.

12. incolumi Iove: ablative absolute, best rendered by a con-
cessive clause introduced by “ although,’' or “ while yet.” Iove is
here put for the great temple of Jove on the Capitol, the symbol of
Rome’s power. Cp. iii. 42, stet Capitolium.
