the attention of Vergil and Varius, who introduced him to
Maecenas. The latter was, with Agrippa and Messala, at
once a leading political figure and a warm patron of litera-
ture. He introduced Horace to the highest literary society
of the time, including at different dates, besides Varius and
Vergil and many lesser lights, the great names of Tibullus
and Ovid. Propertius too was probably an acquaintance,
but not a friend, of Horace. His patron also presented
Horace to the Emperor Augustus, whom the poet long
treated with respect without affection; and finally Mae-
cenas gave him a small estate amongst the Sabine Hills,
about fifteen miles from Tibur. At the latter place also the
poet had a small villa ; and between his farm, his villa, and
Rome, he spent the remaining years of his life, dying on
November 27th, 8 Β.Ο., 3 few weeks after Maecenas.

ξ 2. His Writings.—In giving his son so liberal an
education the father of Horace must have trusted that he
would one day turn it to good account. Unfortunately,
the death of Caesar and the subsequent civil war occurred
just at that period when the worth of that eduoation would
under happier circumstances have shown itself ; and, as
we have seen, Horace was driven to the merest drudgery
s or a living. His own disgust may have led him to indulge
in the Satires, of which the first Book probably appeared
about 35 ΒΩ. The second Book followed in 30, and in
the same year—the year after Augustus overthrew his
last opponent, Antonius, at Actium—appeared the first of
Horace's lyric compositions, the Epodes. The poet no
longer had any excuse for writing satire, as he was already
able to address Maecenas as amice, and was on the high
road to fortune. The first three Books of the Odes appeared
before the end of 23 B.o. ; in 17 was written the Carmen
Saeculare, an Ode to be sung at the celebration of the Isudi
Saeculares, or Centennial Games ; and between 17 and
13 was composed the fourth and last Book of the Odes.

The Epistles-letters to various friends in the form of
verse—are in two Books : the first was published in 20 13.c.;
