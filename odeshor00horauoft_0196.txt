ODE 111.

OF THE REwARDs or Rmnrnous PERSEVERANOE ΛΝΒ Temarun-
ans, AND THE EXAMPLES or TROY Am) Rome.

ARGUMENT.—-Ri9hteous couraqe knows no sear. ’Twas this made
Hercules and Bacchus immortal, and ’twas this qave immortality even
to Romulus, when the ,vods debated his merite and Juno spake :—

“ Troy has fallen sor the fraud of Laomedon, for so I decreed it.
Helen and Paris and his people are rw more, and their war is ended.
I will soryive the rest, and I will suffer Romulus, thouqh of Trojan
blood, to take his place in heaven. His people, the fuqitivee srom
Troy, may rule even over the peoples os the E'ast, and spread their
name from the Nile to the Atlantia, provided Troy lies waste, ami
that they lust not aster qold at any price. Their destiny shall be lo
conquer from the tropice to the pole, if but they seek not to mal-e Troy
live aqain. In an evil day shall they attempt it, and with evil iem:
for I, the queen of heaven, will fiyht aqainst them! Y ea, to the third
{ime would I rase it, thouqh it were built by qods! ''

I My lyre is unfit sor so hiqh a theme as this .· Ι do bul debase it, and
will refrain.

Virum is the object of quatit (v. 4).

4. mente : ablativo of respect.

7. inlabatur: where the tense of the apodosis is future, as here
(ferient), the protasis is usually future also. The subjunctive is used
because the falling of the sky is a mere supposition, whereas the
fearlessness of the righteous man is regarded as a certainty and is
therefore put in the indicative.

9. arte : i.e. the ‘⁶ quality '³ of righteous determination.

10. attigit ε attiqerunt would bc more usual; but in Horace “it is
common to find a singular verb with two or three subjects where all,
or the one nearest to the verb, are singular '’ (Wickham). igneas :
‘⁴ starlit,’‘ because the stars are fiery.

ll. quos inter : the prepositions inter and circum frequently stand
aster their nouns. In v. 37 inter is quite separated from its case.
Augustus : this title was conferred on Octavianus in 27 B.c.

122. †bibet : there is variant reading bibit, as though Augustus were
already numbered amongst the gods when Horace was writing
