INTRODUCTION. 5

limits the date of the publication of II. and III. Ode 4
of Book II. was written in 25 B.c., when Horace was forty
years of age; Ode 9 after 27 B.c., when Octavianus was
first called Augustus ; and Ode 10, like Ode 2, before 23.

In Book HL, we may place Ode 3 after 27 Β.ο. (see
II. 9) ; Ode 14 in 24, when Augustus returned from Spain;
and Ode 19 before 23 (see Π. 2, 10).

The latest date of each of the first three Books is there-
fore 23 B.c.‚ and in this year they were probably all
published. The earliest ascertainable date at which any
were written is 30 B.C. (Ι. 27) ; it is, however, possible that
some were written earlier, for, although the Epodes were
published early in 30, they contain only iambic metres,
and Horace may purposely have withheld some poems in
other metres and published them in the collection of Odes.

The date of the Carmen saeculare is 17 B.c. : it was
written at the special request of the Emperor for the Ludi
Saeculares in that year.

Book IV. was written between 17 and 13 B.c.‚ and pub-
lished in 13 B.c. Four of its fifteen odes can be dated :
Odes 4 and 14 in 15, when Drusus and Tiberius defeated
the Rhaeti and Vindelici3 Ode 5 in 13, when Augustus
returned from Spain; and Ode 6 in 17, the same year
as the Carmen Saeculare.

A difficulty has been raised by Ι. 3 and IV. 12, two Odes
addressed to Vergilius, often supposed to be the poet. Ι. 3
on that supposition refers to Vergil’s last voyage from
Greece in 19 B.c., and would therefore make the publica-
tion of I. fall later than 23; but IV. 12 contains phrases
which cannot refer to the poet; another Vergil must be
meant, and if I. 3 also was addressed to this other Vergil,
the difficulty as to the date of Book Ι. vanishes.

The plan on which the Odes are arranged is clearly not
chronological, nor is it easy to discover any definite plan
at all, except in Book IV., and, to a slighter extent, in
Book III. Horace certainly had some artistic design, and
his general idea was apparently to give as much variety of
style and metre as possible. He studiously avoids the
