NoTEs. 187

objective genitive regularly follows adjectives denoting skill or its
opposite. Aymen is properly a ‘⁴ line of march‚” then “ men march-
ing,’' and here “military service.''

ll. tactu: with asperum—“ dangerous to handle.⁷' The supine
in -u is an ablative of respect.

13. decorumst : i.e. decorum est. This line is a good example of
the use of the infinitive as a noun (nominative), mori corresponding
with mors in the next line.

17. repulsae ε for the case, cp. rudis cyminum, v. 9. The meta-
phors in this stanza are taken from electioneering : a candidate seeks
office (honores, v. 18) 3 if he attains the consulate or the praetorship‚
he assumes (sumit) the fasces (securae, v. 19) for a year, and lays them
down again (ponit) at its close. He owes his election to popular
favour (popularis aura, v. 20); and if he fails to win it, he suffers
defeat (repulsa, v. 17).

18. honoribus ε the technical term for public magistracies in Rome,
ας. consulate, praetorship, aedileship, quaestorship.

19. secures: the axe, bound round with rods (virqae), which
lictors carried before the magistrate to symbolise his power to
execute or to flog.

20. arbitrio: causal ablative—“ at the bidding of the popular
breath,'’ i.e. of popular favour.

21. recludens : ‘⁴ opening.” Notice the reversing force of the
prefix re, and cp. fiqo and refiyo, texo and retexo. inmeritis mori : the
dative is one of advantage. The infinitive mori stands as direct
object of the verbal notion contained in the adjective inmeriti->¹ (eis
qui non merentur), and is equivalent to mortem. Cp. v. 13, n.

22. via : ablative of the “ road by which.'' The road to immor-
tality is prohibited (ηεςαέα), but yet sought after.

26. vetabo: veto is usually followed by an accusative and an
infinitive, both standing in the relation of objects to velo. Here
their place is taken by object clauses containing jussive subjunctives,
which are said to be in “ semi-dependence ’³ on vetabo. The ante-
cedent of the relative clause, qui . . . volqarit (i.e. volqaverz't), is the
suppressed subject of sit and solvat.

27. volgarit : future-perfect, the leading verb being in the future
(vetabo).

28. trabibus : ‘⁶ roos-beams.” mecum : when used with a personal
pronoun, or the relative qui, the preposition cum becomes enclitic,
i.e. is appended to its case.

29. phaselon : Greek form of the accusative, the nominative being
phaselos. Ρήαεὲἰόε denotes in Greek (l) ‘⁶ a kidney bean,’' (2) ‘⁴ a
light boat '⁷ shaped like a pod. Solvere is the regular word for
unmooring‚ casting off, a vessel from the shore.

30. addidit ε this perfect, like deseruit, may be either a true perfect
