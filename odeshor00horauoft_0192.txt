184 HORAOE, onas 111., 1.

10. arbusta: the trees (usually elms) upon which the vines were
trained. They were planted in regular rows (ordines, hence ordinet)
along trenches (sulci). sulcis: ablative of place, frequently used
in poetry without a preposition. In prose a preposition is required,
except with the name of a town and in certain expressions. gene-
rosior: “better born. ’ The word comes from qenus, and has not
the same meaning as its derivative“ generous. ‘’ hic. .hic. .i11i:

‘.one ...one ..''another

11. campum : ale. the Campus Martius, a large level space of open
ground to the N. and W. of the city, lying within a bend of the river
Tiber. It was the customary place of meeting for elections (comitia)
and other public business which concerned the entire peop1e; and
here, too, the young Romans amused themselves with riding, running,
hall-play, and other exercises. A man was said descendere in campum,
because it lay lower than the city. petitor : peto is the proper word
for “ being a candidate ⁷³ for public office ; hence petitio = “ candida-
ture,” and petitor z ‘⁶ a candidate.''

12. moribus . . . fama: ablative of respect. The adjective melior,

like 9enerosior, is predicative, and must be the emphatic word in
an English version.

13. illi : the usual dative of the possessor with esse. clientium : a
wealthy or distinguished Roman was the patron (patronus) of a
number of men of humble station. These were his “ clients,” and
they were expected to attend their patron upon any occasion when
he appeared in public, eq. when canvassing for election. In return
for this and other services, and certain money payments, the patronus
was bound to protect his cliens, and defend him in the law-courts,

15. sortitur : ‘⁴ casts lots about‚'’ “ allots their fate to.'’ The verb
is more usually found with an accusative of the thing, eq. sortiri
provinciam, ‘⁴ to assign a province by lot.”

16. urna: in casting lots, the names of the different persons
eoncerncd would be written upon slips of wood and shaken up
together in a box, vessel (urna), or helmet. The man whose name
was first to fall out would be the one chosen.

17. cui ε possessive dative for the more usual genitive. The
natural position for the relative would be first in the clause. Notice
the use of cervix in the singular : Ciceronian prose only allows the
plural cervices.

19. elaborabunt: ‘work out‚” “‚produoe '' with the idea of great
eost of time and trouble. Supply illi as indirect object and as ante-
cedent to cui above.

24. tempe. the vale of Tempe, through which the Thessalian river
Peneus makes its way to the sea, between mounts Olympus and Ossa,
was of proverbial beauty; so much so that the name came to be used
as a common noun, meaning a “ beautiful valley.’' Tempe is a Greek
neuter plural, and is used only in the nominative and accusative.
