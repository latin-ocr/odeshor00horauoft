ODE XXX.
OF THE Ponr’s IMMORTALITY: AN Ermoenn.

ARGUMENT.—My monument is qrander and more lastinq than the
pyramide, and it will weather storm and time. I shall be immortaL
and men will speak of me as the poet who first acclinmtised in Italy
the lyric poetry of Alcaeus and Sappho.

[Soc Index for Aeolius, Aufidus, Daunus, Delphi, Libitina.]

2. situ: situs is a verbal substantive from sino, ‘⁴ I permit‚'' of
which verb the original meaning was “ I lay ’‘; situs, therefore,
dcnotes “ a being laid or placed,'’ whence it gets its meaning here of
‘⁴ construction? ‘⁴ architecture‚’‘ and also its ordinary meaning of
“ situati0n‚” “ site.’'

3. inpotens : see xxix. 41, n.

4. possit: the subjunctive is consecutive, and the relative quod
introducing it is equivalent to tale ut id.

7. usque: with crescam. Postera means “ of posterity.”

9. scandet : dum, meaning “ all the time that,‘' requires the same
tense as the principal verb (crescam). The verb scando implies the
steep ascent of the Capitol. virgine ε “ vestal.'' The vestal virgins were
chosen from the noblest families in Rome to tend the eternal fire in
the temple of Vesta (q.v. Index). They took an oath of perpetual
virginity, and amongst their duties was the attendance at certain
great religious ceremonies. pontifex : xxiii. 12, n.

10-12. qua . . . populorum: the clause may be taken either with
dicar or with deduxisse, but far preferably with the latter; Horace
looks forward to world-wide, not merely to local, fame.

ll. aquae : the genitive is used because of the idea of “ wanting ”
in pauper. Cp. inane lymphae, xi. 26.

12. populorum: requam, as stated in the note 011 xxix. 27, is
intransitive; it is here followed by an objective genitive dependent
on the substantival notion (rex) contained in the verb, and in
imitation of the construction of verbs of rulinq in Greek. ex humili :
lit. “ mighty out of (a) poor (man),” i.e. “ mighty after being lowly.”
This use of ex is not uncommon; cp. Transsuqa ex oratore sactus,
‘⁸ Having become a deserter after being an ambassador.'’

13. princeps: “first.'’ By Aeolium carmen Horace means the
Alcaic and Sapphic metres. Alcaeus and Sappho were both lyric
poets of Lesbos, an island of Aeolia, the northern part of the west
coast of Asia Minor, and lived in thc seventh century B.0.

14. deduxisse : deducere is the regular word for leading colonists
from their old to their new home, and is here used metaphorically of
the introduction of Aeolian measures into Latin poetry.

15. mihi : dative of possessor, represented in English by the
possessive adjective.

16. Melpomene : see Index, av. MUSA.
