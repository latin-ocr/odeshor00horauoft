Four-h'ne stanzas, of whjch the first two lines are like the
First Asclepiad and the last one like the shorter line of

the Third Aselepiad, the third line being

Besides Alcaics, Sapphjos, and Asclepiads, there are six
other metres used by Horace in the Odes, perhaps (as has
been suggested) by way of experiment. Of these, the
Alemanian is found in two Odes (I. 7, 28), the rest in one
Ode each.

(d) The Alemanian couplet consists of the common
daotylio hexameter followed by a daotylic tetrameter. The
latter is the same as the hexameter minus the first two feet.

-uul—uvl-Uuul-vwl—uul—-

The caesura may occur after the second syllable of the
third foot of the hexameter, if that is a dactyl. A spondee
in the last foot but one of either verse is rare.

(e) The First Archilochian couplet eonsists of the dactylis
hexameter followed by a dactylio trimeter (verse of three

feet) catalectic.
